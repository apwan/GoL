<p>:<b>101</b> (p5) Found by Achim Flammenkamp in August 1994. The name was
suggested by Bill Gosper, noting that the <a href="#qr">phase</a> shown below
displays the period in binary.
<p><a href='cells/101.cells'><img src='cells/101.png' width='154' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=gk><b>1-2-3</b></a> (p3) Found by Dave Buckingham, August 1972. This is one of only
three essentially different p3 <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> with only three cells in
the <a href="#e5">rotor</a>. The others are <a href="#q3">stillater</a> and <a href="#fr">cuphook</a>.
<p><a href='cells/1-2-3.cells'><img src='cells/1-2-3.png' width='90' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=wx><b>1-2-3-4</b></a> (p4) See also <a href="#mq">Achim's p4</a>.
<p><a href='cells/1-2-3-4.cells'><img src='cells/1-2-3-4.png' width='98' height='98'></a></p>
<p>:<b>14-ner</b> = <a href="#d1">fourteener</a>
<p>:<a name=q2><b>17c/45 spaceship</b></a> A <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> travelling at 17<i>c</i>/45. No such
spaceship has actually been built, but Jason Summers has written up a
plan for making one (see <a href="http://entropymine.com/jason/life/17c45/">http://entropymine.com/jason/life/17c45/</a>).
The resulting spaceship would be so huge that building it without the
aid of specialized software would be practically impossible.
<p>The design for a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship is based on the following
reaction between a <a href="#hg">pi-heptomino</a> and a <a href="#dw">blinker</a>:
<p><a href='cells/17c45_spaceship.cells'><img src='cells/17c45_spaceship.png' width='138' height='50'></a></p>
In this reaction, the pi moves forward 17 cells in the course of 45
generations while the blinker moves back 6 cells and is rephased.
This reaction has been known for many years, but it was only in
September 2002 that David Bell suggested that it could be used to
build a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship, based on a reaction he had found in which
pis crawling along two lines of blinkers interact to emit a glider
every 45 generations. Similar glider-emitting interactions were
later found by Gabriel Nivasch and Jason Summers. The basic idea of
the design is that streams of gliders created in this way can be used
to construct fleets of <a href="#u3">standard spaceships</a> which are used to carry
gliders to the front of the blinker trails, where they can be used to
build more blinkers.
<p>:<b>2 eaters</b> = <a href="#sq">two eaters</a>
<p>:<b>4-8-12 diamond</b> The following <a href="#px">pure glider generator</a>.
<p><a href='cells/4-8-12_diamond.cells'><img src='cells/4-8-12_diamond.png' width='106' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<b>4 boats</b> (p2)
<p><a href='cells/4_boats.cells'><img src='cells/4_boats.png' width='74' height='74'></a></p>
<p>:<b>4F</b> = <a href="#uo">Fast Forward Force Field</a>
<p>:<a name=l6><b>Achim's p144</b></a> (p144) This was found (minus the blocks shown below)
on a cylinder of width 22 by Achim Flammenkamp in July 1994. Dean
Hickerson reduced it to a finite form using <a href="#f8">figure-8s</a> the same day.
The neater finite form shown here - replacing the figure-8s with
blocks - was found by David Bell in August 1994. See <a href="#z8">factory</a> for
a use of this oscillator.
<p><a href='cells/Achims_p144.cells'><img src='cells/Achims_p144.png' width='234' height='162'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=rd><b>Achim's p16</b></a> (p16) Found by Achim Flammenkamp, July 1994.
<p><a href='cells/Achims_p16.cells'><img src='cells/Achims_p16.png' width='114' height='114'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=mq><b>Achim's p4</b></a> (p4) Dave Buckingham found this in a less compact form
(using two halves of <a href="#l4">sombreros</a>) in 1976. The form shown here was
found by Achim Flammenkamp in 1988. The <a href="#e5">rotor</a> is two copies of
the rotor of <a href="#wx">1-2-3-4</a>, so the oscillator is sometimes called the
"dual 1-2-3-4".
<p><a href='cells/Achims_p4.cells'><img src='cells/Achims_p4.png' width='98' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<b>Achim's p5</b> = <a href="#av">pseudo-barberpole</a>
<p>:<b>Achim's p8</b> (p8) Found by Achim Flammenkamp, July 1994.
<p><a href='cells/Achims_p8.cells'><img src='cells/Achims_p8.png' width='82' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=lq><b>acorn</b></a> (stabilizes at time 5206) A <a href="#w2">methuselah</a> found by Charles
Corderman.
<p><a href='cells/acorn.cells'><img src='cells/acorn.png' width='66' height='34'></a></p>
<p>:<b>A for all</b> (p6) Found by Dean Hickerson in March 1993.
<p><a href='cells/A_for_all.cells'><img src='cells/A_for_all.png' width='90' height='90'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=ag><b>agar</b></a> Any pattern covering the whole plane that is periodic in both
space and time. The simplest (nonempty) agar is the <a href="#h3">stable</a> one
extended by the known <a href="#ux">spacefillers</a>. For some more examples see
<a href="#zg">chicken wire</a>, <a href="#rh">houndstooth agar</a>, <a href="#rj">onion rings</a>, <a href="#cf">squaredance</a>
and <a href="#i0">Venetian blinds</a>. Tiling the plane with the pattern <tt>O......O</tt>
produces another interesting example: a p6 agar which has a phase of
<a href="#jb">density</a> 3/4, which is the highest yet obtained for any phase of an
oscillating pattern.
<p>:<a name=jd><b>aircraft carrier</b></a> (p1) This is the smallest <a href="#nu">still life</a> that has more
than one <a href="#lt">island</a>.
<p><a href='cells/aircraft_carrier.cells'><img src='cells/aircraft_carrier.png' width='42' height='34'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=al><b>airforce</b></a> (p7) Found by Dave Buckingham in 1972. The rotor consists
of two copies of that used in the <a href="#s2">burloaferimeter</a>.
<p><a href='cells/airforce.cells'><img src='cells/airforce.png' width='122' height='130'></a></p>
<p>:<b>AK47 reaction</b> The following reaction (found by Rich Schroeppel and
Dave Buckingham) in which a honey farm predecessor, catalysed by
an eater and a block, reappears at another location 47 generations
later, having produced a glider and a traffic light. This is the
basis of a very small (but <a href="#ti">pseudo</a>) p94 glider gun found by Paul
Callahan in July 1994, and was in 1990 the basis for the Dean
Hickerson's construction of the first <a href="#ho">true</a> p94 gun. (This latter
gun was enormous, and has now been superceded by comparatively small
<a href="#ba">Herschel loop</a> guns.)
<p><a href='cells/AK47_reaction.cells'><img src='cells/AK47_reaction.png' width='90' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<b>Al Jolson</b> = <a href="#h2">Jolson</a>
<p>:<b>almosymmetric</b> (p2) Found in 1971.
<p><a href='cells/almosymmetric.cells'><img src='cells/almosymmetric.png' width='82' height='74'></a></p>
<p>:<b>antlers</b> = <a href="#ik">moose antlers</a>
<p>:<a name=sx><b>ants</b></a> (p5 wick) The standard form is shown below. It is also
possible for any ant to be displaced by one or two cells relative
to either or both of its neighbouring ants. Dean Hickerson found
<a href="#l8">fenceposts</a> for both ends of this wick in October 1992 and
February 1993. See <a href="#ft">electric fence</a>, and also <a href="#h4">wickstretcher</a>.
<p><a href='cells/ants.cells'><img src='cells/ants.png' width='362' height='42'></a></p>
<p>:<b>anvil</b> The following <a href="#qc">induction coil</a>.
<p><a href='cells/anvil.cells'><img src='cells/anvil.png' width='66' height='42'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=wh><b>APPS</b></a> (<i>c</i>/5 orthogonally, p30) An asymmetric <a href="#ir">PPS</a>. The same as the
<a href="#x1">SPPS</a>, but with the two halves 15 generations out of phase with one
another. Found by Alan Hensel in May 1998.
<p>:<a name=ul><b>ark</b></a> A pair of mutually stabilizing <a href="#x0">switch engines</a>. The archetype
is <a href="#du">Noah's ark</a>.
<p>:<a name=wv><b>arm</b></a> A long extension hanging off from the main body of a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>
or <a href="#z6">puffer</a> perpendicular to the direction of travel.
<p>A lot of known spaceships have multiple arms. This is an artefact
of the search methods used to find such spaceships, rather than an
indication of what a "typical" spaceship might look like.
<p>:<b>ash</b> The (<a href="#h3">stable</a> or oscillating) debris left by a random reaction.
Experiments show that for random <a href="#gu">soups</a> with moderate initial
densities (say 0.25 to 0.5) the resulting ash has a density of about
0.0287. (This is, of course, based on what happens in finite fields.
In infinite fields the situation may conceivably be different in the
long run because of the effect of certain initially very rare objects
such as <a href="#uz">replicators</a>.)
<p>:<b>aVerage</b> (p5) Found by Dave Buckingham, 1973. The average number
of live <a href="#e5">rotor</a> cells is five (V), which is also the period.
<p><a href='cells/aVerage.cells'><img src='cells/aVerage.png' width='114' height='98'></a></p>
<p>:<b>B</b> = <a href="#k0">B-heptomino</a>
<p>:<a name=u1><b>B-52 bomber</b></a> The following p104 <a href="#zc">double-barrelled</a> <a href="#bf">glider</a> <a href="#gv">gun</a>.
It uses a <a href="#k0">B-heptomino</a> and emits one glider every 52 generations.
It was found by Noam Elkies in March 1996, except that Elkies used
<a href="#lh">blockers</a> instead of <a href="#d8">molds</a>, the improvement being found by
David Bell later the same month.
<p><a href='cells/B-52_bomber.cells'><img src='cells/B-52_bomber.png' width='322' height='178'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=er><b>babbling brook</b></a> Any <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> whose <a href="#e5">rotor</a> consists of a string
of cells each of which is adjacent to exactly two other rotor cells,
except for the endpoints which are adjacent to only one other rotor
cell. Compare <a href="#x5">muttering moat</a>. Examples include the <a href="#az">beacon</a>, the
<a href="#ma">great on-off</a>, the <a href="#is">light bulb</a> and the <a href="#jz">spark coil</a>. The following
less trivial example (by Dean Hickerson, August 1997) is the only
one known with more than four cells in its rotor. It is p4 and has
a 6-cell rotor.
<p><a href='cells/babbling_brook.cells'><img src='cells/babbling_brook.png' width='138' height='90'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=mc><b>backrake</b></a> Another term for a backwards <a href="#e8">rake</a>. A p8 example by
Jason Summers is shown below. See <a href="#zj">total aperiodic</a> for a p12
example.
<p><a href='cells/backrake.cells'><img src='cells/backrake.png' width='226' height='154'></a></p>
<p>:<b>backward glider</b> A <a href="#bf">glider</a> which moves at least partly in the
opposite direction to the <a href="#z6">puffer</a>(s) or <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>(s) under
consideration.
<p>:<a name=bi><b>baker</b></a> (<i>c</i> p4 fuse) A <a href="#ai">fuse</a> by Keith McClelland.
<p><a href='cells/baker.cells'><img src='cells/baker.png' width='138' height='122'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=qw><b>baker's dozen</b></a> (p12) A <a href="#a4">loaf</a> <a href="#wo">hassled</a> by two <a href="#k1">blocks</a> and two
<a href="#ku">caterers</a>. The original form (using p4 and p6 oscillators to
do the hassling) was found by Robert Wainwright in August 1989.
<p><a href='cells/bakers_dozen.cells'><img src='cells/bakers_dozen.png' width='194' height='98'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=yb><b>bakery</b></a> (p1) A common formation of two bi-loaves.
<p><a href='cells/bakery.cells'><img src='cells/bakery.png' width='90' height='90'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=jy><b>barberpole</b></a> Any p2 oscillator in the infinite sequence <a href="#sh">bipole</a>,
<a href="#r0">tripole</a>, <a href="#rm">quadpole</a>, <a href="#xq">pentapole</a>, <a href="#kt">hexapole</a>, <a href="#gh">heptapole</a> ...
(It wasn't my idea to suddenly change from Latin to Greek.)
This sequence of oscillators was found by the MIT group in 1970.
The term is also used (usually in the form "barber pole") to
describe other extensible sections of oscillators or spaceships,
especially those (usually of period 2) in which all generations
look alike except for a translation and/or rotation/reflection.
<p>:<b>barberpole intersection</b> = <a href="#uf">quad</a>
<p>:<b>barber's pole</b> = <a href="#jy">barberpole</a>
<p>:<b>barge</b> (p1)

<p>:<b>basic shuttle</b> = <a href="#dg">queen bee shuttle</a>
<p>:<a name=az><b>beacon</b></a> (p2) The third most common <a href="#wu">oscillator</a>. Found by Conway,
March 1970.
<p><a href='cells/beacon.cells'><img src='cells/beacon.png' width='42' height='42'></a></p>

<p>:<b>beehive with tail</b> (p1)
<p><a href='cells/beehive_with_tail.cells'><img src='cells/beehive_with_tail.png' width='58' height='50'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=rf><b>belly spark</b></a> The spark of a <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> or <a href="#lg">HWSS</a> other than the
<a href="#r9">tail spark</a>.
<p>:<a name=op><b>bent keys</b></a> (p3) Found by Dean Hickerson, August 1989. See also
<a href="#gp">odd keys</a> and <a href="#ph">short keys</a>.
<p><a href='cells/bent_keys.cells'><img src='cells/bent_keys.png' width='106' height='50'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=k0><b>B-heptomino</b></a> (stabilizes at time 148) This is a very common
pattern. It often arises with the cell at top left shifted one
space to the left, which does not affect the subsequent evolution.
B-heptominoes acquired particular importance in 1996 due
to Dave Buckingham's work on <a href="#c6">B tracks</a> - see in particular
<a href="#yq">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>.
<p><a href='cells/B-heptomino.cells'><img src='cells/B-heptomino.png' width='42' height='34'></a></p>

<p>:<a name=e9><b>big glider</b></a> (<i>c</i>/4 diagonally, p4) This was found by Dean Hickerson in
December 1989 and was the first known diagonal <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> other than
the <a href="#bf">glider</a>.
<p><a href='cells/big_glider.cells'><img src='cells/big_glider.png' width='154' height='154'></a></p>

<p>:<b>big table</b> = <a href="#gt">dock</a>
<p>:<a name=o5><b>billiard table configuration</b></a> Any <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> in which the <a href="#e5">rotor</a>
is enclosed within the <a href="#c9">stator</a>. Examples include <a href="#al">airforce</a>,
<a href="#h5">cauldron</a>, <a href="#yr">clock II</a>, <a href="#ny">Hertz oscillator</a>, <a href="#ow">negentropy</a>,
<a href="#ce">pinwheel</a>, <a href="#o7">pressure cooker</a> and <a href="#wj">scrubber</a>.
<p>:<a name=dx><b>bi-loaf</b></a> This term has been used in at least three different senses.
A bi-loaf can be half a <a href="#yb">bakery</a>:
<p><a href='cells/bi-loaf.cells'><img src='cells/bi-loaf.png' width='66' height='66'></a></p>
or it can be the following much less common <a href="#nu">still life</a>:
<p><a href='cells/bi-loaf2.cells'><img src='cells/bi-loaf2.png' width='66' height='66'></a></p>
or the following <a href="#px">pure glider generator</a>:
<p><a href='cells/bi-loaf3.cells'><img src='cells/bi-loaf3.png' width='42' height='66'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=sh><b>bipole</b></a> (p2) The <a href="#jy">barberpole</a> of length 2.

<p>:<a name=bw><b>biting off more than they can chew</b></a> (p3) Found by Peter Raynham,
July 1972.

<p>:<b>Black&amp;White</b> = <a href="#ys">Immigration</a>
<p>:<b>blasting cap</b> The <a href="#hg">pi-heptomino</a> (after the shape at generation 1).
A term used at MIT and still occasionally encountered.
<p>:<a name=dw><b>blinker</b></a> (p2) The smallest and most common <a href="#wu">oscillator</a>. Found by
Conway, March 1970.
<p><a href='cells/blinker.cells'><img src='cells/blinker.png' width='34' height='18'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=kl><b>blinker puffer</b></a> Any <a href="#z6">puffer</a> whose output is <a href="#dw">blinkers</a>. However,
the term is particularly used for p8 <i>c</i>/2 puffers. The first such
blinker puffer was found by Robert Wainwright in 1984, and was
unexpectedly simple:
<p><a href='cells/blinker_puffer.cells'><img src='cells/blinker_puffer.png' width='82' height='154'></a></p>
Since then many more blinker puffers have been found. The following
one was found by David Bell in 1992 when he was trying to extend an
<a href="#kw">x66</a>:
<p><a href='cells/blinker_puffer2.cells'><img src='cells/blinker_puffer2.png' width='146' height='210'></a></p>
The importance of this larger blinker puffer (and others like it), is
that the engine which produces the blinker output is only p4. The
blinker row produced by the puffer can easily be ignited, and burns
cleanly with a speed of 2<i>c</i>/3. When the burning catches up to the
engine, it causes a <a href="#nw">phase change</a> in the puffer. This fact allows
p8 blinker puffers to be used to construct rakes of all periods which
are large multiples of four.
<p>:<b>blinkers bit pole</b> (p2) Found by Robert Wainwright, June 1977.
<p><a href='cells/blinkers_bit_pole.cells'><img src='cells/blinkers_bit_pole.png' width='66' height='58'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=zd><b>blinker ship</b></a> A <a href="#t6">growing spaceship</a> in which the wick consists of
a line of <a href="#dw">blinkers</a>. An example by Paul Schick based on his
<a href="#j0">Schick engine</a> is shown below. Here the front part is p12 and
moves at <i>c</i>/2, while the back part is p26 and moves at 6<i>c</i>/13. Every
156 generations 13 blinkers are created and 12 are destroyed, so the
wick becomes one blinker longer.

<p><a href='cells/boat.cells'><img src='cells/boat.png' width='34' height='34'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=ak><b>boat-bit</b></a> A binary digit represented by the presence of a
<a href="#ci">boat</a> next to a <a href="#v2">snake</a> (or other suitable object, such as
an <a href="#jd">aircraft carrier</a>). The bit can be toggled by a <a href="#bf">glider</a>
travelling along a certain path. A correctly timed glider on a
crossing path can detect whether the transition was from 1 to 0
(in which case the crossing glider is deleted) or from 0 to 1 (in
which case it passes unharmed). Three gliders therefore suffice for
a non-destructive read. The mechanisms involved are shown in the
diagram below. Here the bit is shown in state 0. It is about to
be set to 1 and then switched back to 0 again. The first crossing
glider will survive, but the second will be destroyed. (In January
1997 David Bell found a method of reading the bit while setting it
to 0. A <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> is fired at the boat-bit. If it is already 0 then
the MWSS passes unharmed, but if it is 1 then the boat and the MWSS
are destroyed and, with the help of an <a href="#hb">eater1</a>, converted into a
glider which travels back along exactly the same path that is used
by the gliders that toggle the boat-bit.)

<p>:<a name=xb><b>breeder</b></a> Any pattern whose <a href="#yv">population</a> grows at a quadratic rate,
although it is usual to exclude <a href="#ux">spacefillers</a>. It is easy to see
that this is the fastest possible growth rate.
<p>The term is also sometimes used to mean specifically the breeder
created by Bill Gosper's group at MIT, which was the first known
pattern exhibiting superlinear growth.
<p>There are four basic types of breeder, known as MMM, MMS, MSM and
SMM (where M=moving and S=stationary). Typically an MMM breeder is a
<a href="#e8">rake</a> <a href="#z6">puffer</a>, an MMS breeder is a puffer producing puffers which
produce stationary objects (<a href="#nu">still lifes</a> and/or <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>),
an MSM breeder is a <a href="#gv">gun</a> puffer and an SMM breeder is a rake gun.
There are, however, less obvious variants of these types. The
original breeder was of type MSM (a p64 puffer puffing p30 glider
guns).
<p>The known breeder with the smallest initial population is the
<a href="#p2">metacatacryst</a>.
<p>:<b>bridge</b> A term used in naming certain <a href="#nu">still lifes</a> (and the <a href="#c9">stator</a>

<p>:<a name=vk><b>caber tosser</b></a> Any pattern whose <a href="#yv">population</a> is asymptotic to <i>c</i>.log(<i>t</i>)
for some constant <i>c</i>, and which contains a <a href="#bf">glider</a> (or other
<a href="#f4">spaceship</a>) bouncing between a slower receding spaceship and a
fixed <a href="#wk">reflector</a> which emits a spaceship (in addition to the
reflected one) whenever the bouncing spaceship hits it.
<p>As the receding spaceship gets further away the bouncing spaceship
takes longer to complete each cycle, and so the extra spaceships
emitted by the reflector are produced at increasingly large
intervals. More precisely, if <i>v</i> is the speed of the bouncing
spaceship and <i>u</i> the speed of the receding spaceship, then each
interval is (<i>v</i>+<i>u</i>)/(<i>v</i>-<i>u</i>) times as long as the previous one. The
population at time <i>t</i> is therefore <i>n</i>.log(<i>t</i>)/log((<i>v</i>+<i>u</i>)/(<i>v</i>-<i>u</i>)) + O(1),
where <i>n</i> is the population of one of the extra spaceships (assumed
constant).
<p>The first caber tosser was built by Dean Hickerson in May 1991.

<p>:<a name=hf><b>catacryst</b></a> A 58-cell quadratic growth pattern found by Nick Gotts
in April 2000. This was formerly the smallest known pattern with
superlinear growth, but has since been superceded by the related
<a href="#p2">metacatacryst</a>. The catacryst consists of three <a href="#ul">arks</a> plus a
glider-producing <a href="#x0">switch engine</a>. It produces a block-laying switch
engine every 47616 generations. Each block-laying switch engine has
only a finite life, but the length of this life increases linearly
with each new switch engine, so that the pattern overall grows
quadratically, as an unusual type of MMS <a href="#xb">breeder</a>.
<p>:<b>catalyst</b> An object that participates in a reaction but emerges from
it unharmed. The term is mostly applied to <a href="#nu">still lifes</a>, but can
also be used of <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>, <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>, etc. The still lifes

<p>:<b>cavity</b> = <a href="#rg">eater plug</a>
<p>:<a name=vu><b>cell</b></a> The fundamental unit of space in the Life universe. The term is
often used to mean a live cell - the sense is usually clear from the
context.
<p>:<a name=g6><b>cellular automaton</b></a> A certain class of mathematical objects of which
<a href="#pl">Life</a> is an example. A cellular automaton consists of a number of
things. First there is a positive integer <i>n</i> which is the dimension
of the cellular automaton. Then there is a finite set of states <i>S</i>,
with at least two members. A state for the whole cellular automaton
is obtained by assigning an element of <i>S</i> to each point of the
<i>n</i>-dimensional lattice <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> (where <span class="b">Z</span> is the set of all integers).
The points of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup> are usually called cells. The cellular automaton
also has the concept of a neighbourhood. The neighbourhood <i>N</i> of the
origin is some finite (nonempty) subset of <span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>. The neighbourhood
of any other cell is obtained in the obvious way by translating that
of the origin. Finally there is a transition rule, which is a
function from <i>S</i><sup><i>N</i></sup> to <i>S</i> (that is to say, for each possible state of
the neighbourhood the transition rule specifies some cell state).
The state of the cellular automaton evolves in discrete time, with
the state of each cell at time <i>t</i>+1 being determined by the state
of its neighbourhood at time <i>t</i>, in accordance with the transition
rule.
<p>There are some variations on the above definition. It is common
to require that there be a quiescent state, that is, a state such
that if the whole universe is in that state at generation 0 then it
will remain so in generation 1. (In Life the OFF state is quiescent,
but the ON state is not.) Other variations allow spaces other than
<span class="b">Z</span><sup><i>n</i></sup>, neighbourhoods that vary over space and/or time, probabilistic
or other non-deterministic transistion rules, etc.
<p>It is common for the neighbourhood of a cell to be the 3&times;...&times;3
(hyper)cube centred on that cell. (This includes those cases where
the neighbourhood might more naturally be thought of as a proper
subset of this cube.) This is known as the Moore neighbourhood.

<p>:<a name=r4><b>colorized Life</b></a> A <a href="#g6">cellular automaton</a> which is the same as Life
except for the use of a number of different ON states ("colours").
All ON states behave the same for the purpose of applying the Life
rule, but additional rules are used to specify the colour of the
resulting ON cells. Examples are <a href="#ys">Immigration</a> and <a href="#zp">QuadLife</a>.
<p>:<b>colour of a glider</b> The colour of a <a href="#bf">glider</a> is a property of the
glider which remains constant while the glider is moving along a
straight path, but which can be changed when the glider bounces off
a <a href="#wk">reflector</a>. It is an important consideration when building
something using reflectors.
<p>The colour of a glider can be defined as follows. First
choose some cell to be the origin. This cell is then considered
to be white, and all other cells to be black or white in a
checkerboard pattern. (So the cell with coordinates (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) is
white if <i>m</i>+<i>n</i> is even, and black otherwise.) Then the colour of
a glider is the colour of its leading cell when it is in a phase
which can be rotated to look like this:
<p><a href='cells/colour_of_a_glider.cells'><img src='cells/colour_of_a_glider.png' width='34' height='34'></a></p>
<p>A reflector which does not change the colour of gliders obviously
cannot be used to move a glider onto a path of different colour than
it started on. But a 90-degree reflector which does change the
colour of gliders is similarly limited, as the colour of the
resulting glider will depend only on the direction of the glider,
no matter how many reflectors are used. For maximum flexibility,
therefore, both types of reflector are required.

spaceships) and without any of the still lifes or oscillators being
permanently damaged. Probably the most important conduit is the
following remarkable one (Dave Buckingham, July 1996) in which a
<a href="#k0">B-heptomino</a> is transformed into a <a href="#ra">Herschel</a> in 59 generations.

<p>:<a name=oh><b>converter</b></a> A <a href="#l7">conduit</a> in which the input object is not of the same
type as the output object. This term tends to be preferred when
either the input object or the output object is a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>.
<p>The following diagram shows a p8 <a href="#hg">pi-heptomino</a>-to-<a href="#lg">HWSS</a>

larger form (using a <a href="#f8">figure-8</a> instead of the <a href="#ci">boat</a>). The
improvement shown here is by Bill Gosper (August 1996). Dieter
Leithner has since found (much larger) <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> of periods 44,
46 and 60 to replace the <a href="#ko">Kok's galaxy</a>.

<p>:<a name=x6><b>Cordership</b></a> Any <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> based on <a href="#x0">switch engines</a>. These
necessarily move at a speed of <i>c</i>/12 diagonally with a period of 96

in April 1991. Corderships are by far the slowest spaceships yet
constructed, although arbitrarily slow spaceships are known to exist
(see <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>). Hickerson's original Cordership used
13 switch engines. He soon reduced this to 10, and in August 1993
to 7. In July 1998 he reduced it to just 6, and this is shown below.

<a href="#bf">gliders</a>, or other <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>, is fired into some junk.
<p>The most common example is initiated by the following collision
of a glider with a <a href="#k1">block</a>. With a glider stream of even <a href="#ek">period</a>

<p>:<b>de Bruijn diagram</b> = <a href="#ao">de Bruijn graph</a>
<p>:<a name=ao><b>de Bruijn graph</b></a> As applied to Life, a de Bruijn graph is a
graph showing which pieces can be linked to which other pieces
to form form a valid part of a Life pattern of a particular kind.
<p>For example, if we are interested in <a href="#nu">still lifes</a>, then we could
consider 2&times;3 rectangular pieces and the de Bruijn graph would show
which pairs of these can be overlapped to form 3&times;3 squares in which
the centre cell remains unchanged in the next generation.
<p>David Eppstein's search program <a href="#gm">gfind</a> is based on de Bruijn
graphs.
<p>:<a name=jb><b>density</b></a> The density of a pattern is the limit of the proportion of
live cells in a (2<i>n</i>+1)&times;(2<i>n</i>+1) square centred on a particular cell as
<i>n</i> tends to infinity, when this limit exists. (Note that it does not
make any difference what cell is chosen as the centre cell. Also
note that if the pattern is finite then the density is zero.) There
are other definitions of density, but this one will do here.
<p>In 1994 Noam Elkies proved that the maximum density of a stable
pattern is 1/2, which had been the conjectured value. See the paper
listed in the bibliography. Marcus Moore provided a simpler proof
in 1995, and in fact proves that a <a href="#nu">still life</a> with an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i>
<a href="#b3">bounding box</a> has at most (<i>mn</i>+<i>m</i>+<i>n</i>)/2 cells.
<p>But what is the maximum average density of an oscillating pattern?
The answer is conjectured to be 1/2 again, but this remains unproved.
The best upper bound so far obtained is 8/13 (Hartmut Holzwart,
September 1992).
<p>The maximum possible density for a <a href="#qr">phase</a> of an oscillating
pattern is also unknown. An example with a density of 3/4 is known
(see <a href="#ag">agar</a>), but densities arbitrarily close to 1 may perhaps be
possible.

<p><a href='cells/diamond_ring.cells'><img src='cells/diamond_ring.png' width='114' height='114'></a></p>
<p>:<b>diehard</b> Any pattern that vanishes, but only after a long time. The
following example vanishes in 130 generations, which is probably the
limit for patterns of 7 or fewer cells. Note that there is no limit
for higher numbers of cells - e.g., for 8 cells we could have a
glider heading towards an arbitrarily distant blinker.

<p>:<a name=q8><b>dirty</b></a> Opposite of <a href="#bx">clean</a>. A reaction which produces a large amount
of complicated junk which is difficult to control or use is said
to be dirty. Many basic <a href="#pm">puffer engines</a> are dirty and need to
be <a href="#gl">tamed</a> by accompanying <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> in order to produce clean
output.
<p>:<a name=vz><b>diuresis</b></a> (p90) Found by David Eppstein in October 1998. His original
stabilization used <a href="#af">pentadecathlons</a>. The stabilization with
complicated <a href="#nu">still lifes</a> shown here (in two slightly different
forms) was found by Dean Hickerson the following day. The name is
due to Bill Gosper (see <a href="#vt">kidney</a>).

<a href="#lg">HWSS</a> and <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a>, produce domino <a href="#ks">sparks</a>.
<p>:<b>do-see-do</b> The following reaction, found by David Bell in 1996, in
which two <a href="#bf">gliders</a> appear to circle around each other as they are
reflected 90 degrees by a <a href="#my">twin bees shuttle</a>. Four copies of the
reaction can be used to create a p92 glider loop which repeats the
do-see-do reaction forever.

<p>:<a name=zb><b>double block reaction</b></a> A certain reaction that can be used to
stabilize the <a href="#my">twin bees shuttle</a> (qv). This was discovered by
David Bell in October 1996.
<p>The same reaction sometimes works in other situations, as shown in
the following diagram where a pair of blocks eats an <a href="#t2">R-pentomino</a>
and a <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>. (The LWSS version was known at least as early 1994,
when Paul Callahan saw it form spontaneously as a result of firing
a LWSS stream at some random junk.)

Paul Tooke in April 2000, was the first known <i>c</i>/6 spaceship.
All other known <i>c</i>/6 spaceships are <a href="#us">flotillas</a> involving at

<p>:<b>drain trap</b> = <a href="#e1">paperclip</a>
<p>:<a name=nn><b>drifter</b></a> A perturbation moving within a stable pattern. Dean
Hickerson has written a program to search for drifters, with the
hope of finding one which could be moved around a track. Because
drifters can be very small, they could be packed more tightly than
<a href="#ra">Herschels</a>, and so allow the creation of <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> of periods
not yet attained, and possibly prove that Life is <a href="#tt">omniperiodic</a>.
Hickerson has found a number of components towards this end, but
it has proved difficult to change the direction of movement of a
drifter, and so far no complete track has been found. However,
Hickerson has had success using the same search program to find
<a href="#yy">eaters</a> with novel properties, such as that used in <a href="#vz">diuresis</a>.
<p>:<b>dual 1-2-3-4</b> = <a href="#mq">Achim's p4</a>
<p>:<b>early universe</b> Conway's somewhat confusing term for <a href="#ld">sparse Life</a>.
<p>:<a name=yy><b>eater</b></a> Any <a href="#nu">still life</a> that has the ability to interact with certain
patterns without suffering any permanent damage. (If it doesn't
suffer even temporary damage then it may be referred to as a <a href="#h8">rock</a>.)
The <a href="#hb">eater1</a> is a very common eater, and the term "eater" is often
used specifically for this object. Other eaters include <a href="#cu">eater2</a>,
<a href="#vj">eater3</a>, <a href="#r2">eater4</a> and even the humble <a href="#k1">block</a>. (In fact the block
was the first known eater, being found capable of eating beehives
from a <a href="#jh">queen bee</a>.) Another useful eater is shown below, feasting
on a glider.
<p><a href='cells/eater.cells'><img src='cells/eater.png' width='82' height='90'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=hb><b>eater1</b></a> (p1) Usually simply called an <a href="#yy">eater</a>, and also called a
fishhook. Its ability to eat various objects was discovered by
Bill Gosper in 1971.
<p><a href='cells/eater1.cells'><img src='cells/eater1.png' width='42' height='42'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=cu><b>eater2</b></a> (p1) This <a href="#yy">eater</a> was found by Dave Buckingham in the 1970s.
Mostly it works like the ordinary eater (see <a href="#hb">eater1</a>) but with two
slight differences that make it useful despite its size: it takes
longer to recover from each bite and it acts like an eater in two
directions. The first property means that, among other things, it
can eat a <a href="#bf">glider</a> in a position that would destroy a fishhook. This
novel glider-eating action is occasionally of use in itself, and
combined with the symmetry means that an eater2 can eat gliders along
four different paths. An eater2 variant noticed by Stephen Silver in
May 1998 that is useful for obtaining smaller <a href="#b3">bounding boxes</a> can be
seen under <a href="#i7">gliderless</a>.
<p><a href='cells/eater2.cells'><img src='cells/eater2.png' width='66' height='66'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=vj><b>eater3</b></a> (p1) This large symmetric <a href="#yy">eater</a>, found by Dave Buckingham,
has a very different eating action from the <a href="#hb">eater1</a> and <a href="#cu">eater2</a>.
The <a href="#a4">loaf</a> can take bites out things, being flipped over in the
process. The rest of the object merely flips it back again.
<p><a href='cells/eater3.cells'><img src='cells/eater3.png' width='106' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=r2><b>eater4</b></a> (p1) Another <a href="#yy">eater</a> by Dave Buckingham, which he found in
1971, but did not recognize as an eater until 1975 or 1976. It
can't eat <a href="#bf">gliders</a>, but it can be used for various other purposes.
The four NE-most centre cells regrow in a few generations after being
destroyed by taking a bite out of something.

<p><a href='cells/ecologist.cells'><img src='cells/ecologist.png' width='162' height='154'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=q5><b>edge-repair spaceship</b></a> A <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> which has an edge that possesses
no <a href="#ks">spark</a> and yet is able to <a href="#q7">perturb</a> things because of its
ability to repair certain types of damage to itself. The most
useful examples are the following two small p3 <i>c</i>/3 spaceships:
<p><a href='cells/edge-repair_spaceship.cells'><img src='cells/edge-repair_spaceship.png' width='330' height='74'></a></p>
These were found by David Bell in 1992, but the usefulness of
the edge-repair property wasn't recognised until July 1997. The
following diagram (showing an edge-repair spaceship deleting a
<a href="#ra">Herschel</a>) demonstrates the self-repairing action.
<p><a href='cells/edge-repair_spaceship2.cells'><img src='cells/edge-repair_spaceship2.png' width='202' height='66'></a></p>
In October 2000, David Bell found that a <a href="#gg">T-tetromino</a> component of
a <i>c</i>/4 spaceship can also be self-repairing. Stephen Silver noticed
that it could be used to delete beehives and, in November 2000, found
the smallest known <i>c</i>/4 spaceship with this edge-repair component - in
fact, two copies of the component:
<p><a href='cells/edge-repair_spaceship3.cells'><img src='cells/edge-repair_spaceship3.png' width='242' height='154'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=jp><b>edge shooter</b></a> A <a href="#gv">gun</a> which fires its gliders (or whatever) right
at the edge of the pattern, so that it can be used to fire them
closely parallel to others. This is useful for constructing
complex guns. Compare <a href="#h7">glider pusher</a>, which can in fact be used
for making edge shooters.

<p>:<a name=wi><b>emu</b></a> Dave Buckingham's term for a <a href="#ba">Herschel loop</a> that does not emit
<a href="#bf">gliders</a> (and so is "flightless"). All known Herschel loops of
periods 57, 58, 59 and 61 are emus. See also <a href="#as">Quetzal</a>.
<p>:<a name=df><b>emulator</b></a> Any one of three p4 oscillators that produce <a href="#ks">sparks</a>
similar to those produced by <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>, <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> and <a href="#lg">HWSS</a>. See
<a href="#v9">LW emulator</a>, <a href="#v8">MW emulator</a> and <a href="#v5">HW emulator</a>. Larger emulators
are also possible, but they require stabilizing objects to suppress
their <a href="#gj">non-sparks</a> and so are of little use. The emulators were
discovered by Robert Wainwright in June 1980.
<p>:<a name=xo><b>engine</b></a> The active portion of an object (usually a <a href="#z6">puffer</a> or <a href="#gv">gun</a>)
which is considered to actually produce its output, and which
generally permits no variation in how it works. The other parts of
the object are just there to support the engine. For examples, see
<a href="#wm">puffer train</a>, <a href="#j0">Schick engine</a>, <a href="#kl">blinker puffer</a>, <a href="#ff">frothing puffer</a>
and <a href="#sf">line puffer</a>.

<p>:<b>evolutionary factor</b> For an unstable pattern, the time to
stabilization divided by the initial <a href="#yv">population</a>. For example,
the <a href="#t2">R-pentomino</a> has an evolutionary factor of 220.6, while
<a href="#ef">bunnies</a> has an evolutionary factor of 1925.777... The term

<p>:<a name=z8><b>factory</b></a> Another word for <a href="#gv">gun</a>, but not used in the case of glider
guns. The term is also used for a pattern that repeatedly
manufactures objects other than <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> or <a href="#e8">rakes</a>. In this
case the new objects do not move out of the way, and therefore must
be used up in some way before the next one is made. The following
shows an example of a p144 gun which consists of a p144 block
factory whose output is converted into gliders by a p72 oscillator.
(This gun is David Bell's improvement of the one Bill Gosper found
in July 1994. The p72 oscillator is by Robert Wainwright, 1990, and
the block factory is <a href="#l6">Achim's p144</a> minus one of its stabilizing
blocks.)

of others, such as the p6 <a href="#es">pipsquirter</a>, the <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a> and
the p72 oscillator shown under <a href="#z8">factory</a>. Another example, a p4

<p>:<a name=wc><b>Garden of Eden</b></a> A configuration of ON and OFF cells that can only
occur in generation 0. (This term was first used in connection with
cellular automata by John W. Tukey, many years before Life.) It was
known from the start that there are Gardens of Eden in Life, because
of a theorem by Edward Moore that guarantees their existence in
a wide class of cellular automata. Explicit examples have since
been constructed, the first by Roger Banks, et al. at MIT in 1971.

<p>:<a name=wb><b>GIG</b></a> A glider injection gate. This is a device for injecting a
<a href="#bf">glider</a> into a glider stream. The injected glider is synthesized
from one or more incoming <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> assisted by the presence of
the GIG. (This contrasts with some other glider injection reactions
which do not require a GIG.) Gliders already in the glider stream
pass through the GIG without interfering with it. A GIG usually
consists of a small number of oscillators.
<p>Glider injection gates are useful for building glider <a href="#gv">guns</a> with
<a href="#ti">pseudo</a>-periods that are of the form <i>nd</i>, where <i>n</i> is a positive
integer, and <i>d</i> is a proper divisor of some convenient base gun period
(such as 30 or 46), with <i>d</i> &gt; 13.

glider, but he himself has said it was Guy. See also the cryptic

The term "glider" is also occasionally (mis)used to mean "spaceship".
<p>:<a name=de><b>glider-block cycle</b></a> An infinite <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> based on the following
reaction (a variant of the <a href="#w3">rephaser</a>). The oscillator consists of
copies of this reaction displaced 2<i>n</i> spaces from one another (for
some <i>n</i>&gt;6) with blocks added between the copies in order to cause the
reaction to occur again halfway through the period. The period of
the resulting infinite oscillator is 8<i>n</i>-20. (Alternatively, in a
cylindrical universe of width 2<i>n</i> the oscillator just consists of two
gliders and two blocks.)

<p>:<b>glider construction</b> = <a href="#vr">glider synthesis</a>
<p>:<a name=z7><b>glider duplicator</b></a> Any reaction in which one input <a href="#bf">glider</a> is
converted into two output gliders. This can be done either
by <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> or by <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>. The most useful glider
duplicators are those with low <a href="#ek">periods</a>.
<p>The following period 30 glider duplicator demonstrates a simple
glider duplicating mechanism found by Dieter Leithner. The input
glider stream comes in from the upper left, and the output glider
streams leave at the upper and lower right. One of the output glider
streams is inverted, so an <a href="#xg">inline inverter</a> is required to complete
the duplicator.
<p><a href='cells/glider_duplicator.cells'><img src='cells/glider_duplicator.png' width='298' height='226'></a></p>
<p>Spaceship <a href="#l5">convoys</a> which can duplicate gliders are very useful
since they (along with <a href="#ae">glider turners</a>) provide a means to clean up
many dirty puffers by duplicating and turning output gliders so as to
impact into the exhaust to clean it up.
<p>Glider duplicators (and turners) are known for backward gliders
using p2 <i>c</i>/2 spaceships, and for forward gliders using p3 <i>c</i>/3
spaceships. These are the most general duplicators for these speeds.
<p>:<b>glider gun</b> A <a href="#gv">gun</a> which fires <a href="#bf">gliders</a>.
<p>:<b>glider injection gate</b> = <a href="#wb">GIG</a>
<p>:<a name=i7><b>gliderless</b></a> A <a href="#gv">gun</a> is said to be gliderless if it does not use
<a href="#bf">gliders</a>. The purist definition would insist that a glider does
not appear anywhere, even incidentally. For a long time the only
known way to construct <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>, <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> and <a href="#lg">HWSS</a> guns involved
gliders, and it was not until April 1996 that Dieter Leithner
constructed the first gliderless gun (a p46 LWSS gun). The following
diagram shows Leithner's p44 MWSS gun which he discovered in April
1997 (shown with Stephen Silver's May 1998 improvement to the
<a href="#b3">bounding box</a> using a modified <a href="#cu">eater2</a>). This is the smallest
known gliderless gun, and also the smallest known MWSS gun. It is
based on an important p44 oscillator discovered by Dave Buckingham
in early 1992. (Note that a glider shape appears in this gun for
three consecutive generations, but always as part of a larger
<a href="#lo">cluster</a>, so even a purist would regard this gun as gliderless.)

<p>:<a name=h7><b>glider pusher</b></a> An arrangement of a <a href="#dg">queen bee shuttle</a> and a
<a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a> that can push the path of a passing glider
out by one half-diagonal space. This was found by Dieter Leithner
in December 1993 and is shown below. It is useful for constructing
complex <a href="#gv">guns</a> where it may be necessary to produce a number of
gliders travelling on close parallel paths. See also <a href="#jp">edge shooter</a>.

<p>:<a name=vr><b>glider synthesis</b></a> Construction of an object by means of <a href="#bf">glider</a>
collisions. It is generally assumed that the gliders should be
arranged so that they could come from infinity - that is, gliders
should not have had to pass through one another to achieve the
initial arrangement.
<p>Glider syntheses for all <a href="#nu">still lifes</a> and known <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> with
at most 14 cells were found by Dave Buckingham.
<p>Perhaps the most interesting glider syntheses are those of
<a href="#f4">spaceships</a>, because these can be used to create corresponding
<a href="#gv">guns</a> and <a href="#e8">rakes</a>. Many of the <i>c</i>/2 spaceships that are based on
<a href="#u3">standard spaceships</a> have been synthesized, mostly by Mark Niemiec.
In June 1998 Stephen Silver found syntheses for some of the
<a href="#x6">Corderships</a> (although it was not until July 1999 that Jason Summers
used this to build a Cordership gun). In May 2000, Noam Elkies
suggested that a 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship found by Tim Coe in May 1996 might be
a candidate for glider synthesis. Initial attempts to construct a
synthesis for this spaceship got fairly close, but it was only in
March 2003 that Summers and Elkies managed to find a way perform the
crucial last step. Summers then used the new synthesis to build a
<i>c</i>/2 forward rake for the 2<i>c</i>/5 spaceship; this was the first example
in Life of a rake which fires spaceships that travel in the same
direction as the rake but more slowly.
<p>A 3-glider synthesis of a <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a> is shown in the diagram
below. This was found in April 1997 by Heinrich Koenig and came as
a surprise, as it was widely assumed that anything using just three
gliders would already be known.

<p>:<a name=ae><b>glider turner</b></a> An reaction in which a <a href="#bf">glider</a> is turned by an
<a href="#wu">oscillator</a> or a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>. In the former case, the glider
turner is usually called a <a href="#wk">reflector</a>.
<p>Glider turners are easily built using <a href="#u3">standard spaceships</a>.
The following diagram shows a convoy which turns a <a href="#g5">forward glider</a>
90 degrees, with the new glider also moving forwards.

<p>:<b>hashlife</b> A Life algorithm by Bill Gosper that is designed to take
advantage of the considerable amount of repetitive behaviour in many
large patterns of interest. This algorithm is described by Gosper
in his paper listed in the bibliography at the end of this lexicon.
Roughly speaking, the idea is to store subpatterns in a hash table so
that the results of their evolution don't have to be recomputed if
they arise again somewhen, or somewhere, else. This does, however,
mean that complex patterns can require substantial amounts of memory.
Hashlife provides a means of evolving repetitive patterns millions
(or even billions or trillions) of generations further than normal
Life algorithms can manage in a reasonable amount of time. It is
not, however, suitable for showing a continuous display of the
evolution of a pattern, because it works asynchronously - at any
given moment it will usually have evolved different parts of the
pattern through different numbers of generations.

<p>:<a name=ua><b>hassler</b></a> An <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> that works by hassling (repeatedly moving

<p>For a period <i>n</i> oscillator with an <i>r</i>-cell <a href="#e5">rotor</a> the heat is at

<p>:<a name=ba><b>Herschel loop</b></a> A cyclic <a href="#ad">Herschel track</a>. Although no loop of length
less than 256 generations has been constructed it is possible to make
<a href="#wu">oscillators</a> of smaller periods by putting more than one Herschel in
the track. In this way oscillators, and in most cases <a href="#gv">guns</a>, of all

itself). See also <a href="#wi">emu</a> and <a href="#tt">omniperiodic</a>.
<p>:<a name=ee><b>Herschel receiver</b></a> A pattern found by Paul Callahan in 1996, as
part of the first stable glider <a href="#wk">reflector</a>. Used as a receiver,
it converts two parallel input gliders (with path separations of
2, 5, or 6) to an <a href="#t2">R-pentomino</a>, which is then converted to a
Herschel by one of two known mechanisms (the first of which was
found by Dave Buckingham way back in 1972, and the second by
Stephen Silver in October 1997). The version using Buckingham's
R-to-Herschel converter is shown below.

stage consists of two <a href="#bf">gliders</a> on parallel tracks, so the
transmitter and receiver can be separated by any required distance.
The conduit may be <a href="#h3">stable</a>, or may contain low-period <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>.

<p>:<a name=ys><b>Immigration</b></a> A form of <a href="#r4">colorized Life</a> in which there are two types

<p>:<a name=fn><b>inductor</b></a> Any <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> with a row of dead cells down the middle
and whose two halves are mirror images of one another, both halves
being required for the oscillator to work. The classic examples are
the <a href="#xe">pulsar</a> and the <a href="#b4">tumbler</a>. If still lifes are considered as
p1 oscillators then there are numerous simple examples such as
<a href="#v6">table on table</a>, <a href="#st">dead spark coil</a> and <a href="#pu">cis-mirrored R-bee</a>.
Some spaceships, such as the <a href="#ax">brain</a>, the <a href="#ym">snail</a> and the <a href="#ja">spider</a>
use the same principle.
<p>:<b>infinite glider hotel</b> A pattern by David Bell, named after Hilbert's
"infinite hotel" scenario in which a hotel with an infinite number of
rooms has room for more guests even if it is already full, simply by
shuffling the old guests around.
<p>In this pattern, two pairs of <a href="#x6">Corderships</a> moving at <i>c</i>/12 are
pulling apart such that there is an ever-lengthening <a href="#bf">glider</a> track
between them. Every 128 generations another glider is injected into
the glider track, joining the gliders already circulating there.
The number of gliders in the track therefore increases without limit.
<p>The tricky part of this construction is that even though all
the previously injected gliders are repeatedly flying through the
injection point, that point is guaranteed to be empty when it is
time for the next glider to be injected.
<p>:<a name=cy><b>infinite growth</b></a> Growth of a finite pattern such that the
<a href="#yv">population</a> tends to infinity, or at least is unbounded.
The first known pattern with infinite growth was the
<a href="#w8">Gosper glider gun</a>.
<p>An interesting question is: What is the minimum population of a
pattern that exhibits infinite growth? In 1971 Charles Corderman
found that a <a href="#x0">switch engine</a> could be stabilized by a <a href="#vw">pre-block</a>
in a number of different ways, giving 11-cell patterns with
infinite growth. This record stood for more than quarter of a
century until Paul Callahan found, in November 1997, two 10-cell
patterns with infinite growth. The following month he found the
one shown below, which is much neater, being a single <a href="#lo">cluster</a>.
This produces a stabilized switch engine of the block-laying type.
<p><a href='cells/infinite_growth.cells'><img src='cells/infinite_growth.png' width='74' height='58'></a></p>
Nick Gotts and Paul Callahan have also shown that there is no
infinite growth pattern with fewer than 10 cells, so that the
question has now been answered.
<p>Also of interest is the following pattern (again found by
Callahan), which is the only 5&times;5 pattern with infinite growth.
This too emits a block-laying switch engine.
<p><a href='cells/infinite_growth2.cells'><img src='cells/infinite_growth2.png' width='50' height='50'></a></p>
<p>Following a conjecture of Nick Gotts, Stephen Silver produced, in
May 1998, a pattern of width 1 which exhibits infinite growth. This
pattern was very large (12470&times;1 in the first version, reduced to
5447&times;1 the following day). In October 1998 Paul Callahan did an
exhaustive search, finding the smallest example, the 39&times;1 pattern
shown below. This produces two block-laying switch engines,
stability being achieved at generation 1483.
<p><a href='cells/infinite_growth3.cells'><img src='cells/infinite_growth3.png' width='322' height='18'></a></p>
<p>Although the simplest infinite growth patterns grow at a rate that
is (asymptotically) linear, many other types of growth rate are
possible, quadratic growth (see <a href="#xb">breeder</a>) being the fastest. Dean
Hickerson has found many patterns with unusual growth rates, such as
<a href="#ss">sawtooths</a> and a <a href="#vk">caber tosser</a>.

<p>:<a name=eg><b>intermitting glider gun</b></a> Despite the name, an intermitting glider gun
(IMG) is more often an <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> than a <a href="#gv">gun</a>. There are two
basic types. A type 1 IMG consists of two guns firing at one another
in such a way that each gun is temporarily disabled on being hit
by a glider from the other gun. A type 2 IMG consists of a single
gun firing at a 180-degree glider <a href="#wk">reflector</a> in such a way that
returning gliders temporarily disable the gun.
<p>Both types of IMG can be used to make glider guns of periods that
are multiples of the base period. This is done by firing another
gun across the two-way intermittent glider stream of the IMG in such
a way that gliders only occasionally escape.
<p>:<a name=lt><b>island</b></a> The individual <a href="#k8">polyplets</a> of which a <a href="#h3">stable</a> pattern

<p>:<a name=tm><b>Jaws</b></a> A <a href="#xb">breeder</a> constructed by Nick Gotts in February 1997. In the
original version Jaws had an initial <a href="#yv">population</a> of 150, which at
the time was the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear
growth. In November 1997 Gotts produced a 130-cell Jaws using
some <a href="#x0">switch engine</a> <a href="#yj">predecessors</a> found by Paul Callahan. Jaws
has since been beaten by the even smaller <a href="#oq">mosquitos</a>, <a href="#lf">teeth</a>,

<p>Jaws consists of eight pairs of switch engines which produce a

generations. It is therefore an MMS breeder.

<p>:<b>knightship</b> Any <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> of type (2<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i>. Such spaceships do
exist (see <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>), but no concrete example is
known. A knightship must be asymmetric and its period must be at
least 6, which makes searching for them using programs like <a href="#fw">lifesrc</a>
very difficult.
<p>By analogy with the corresponding fairy chess pieces, spaceships of
types (3<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i>, (3<i>m</i>,2<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> and (4<i>m</i>,<i>m</i>)/<i>n</i> would presumably be called
camelships, zebraships and giraffeships, respectively. But no
examples of these are known either, and they are even more difficult
to search for.

<p>:<a name=pl><b>Life</b></a> A 2-dimensional 2-state <a href="#g6">cellular automaton</a> discovered by
John Conway in 1970. The states are referred to as ON and OFF (or
live and dead). The transistion rule is as follows: a cell that is
ON will remain ON in the next generation if and only if exactly 2
or 3 of the 8 adjacent cells are also ON, and a cell that is OFF will
turn ON if and only if exactly 3 of the 8 adjacent cells are ON.
(This is more succinctly stated as: "If 2 of your 8 nearest
neighbours are ON, don't change. If 3 are ON, turn ON. Otherwise,
turn OFF.")

<p>:<a name=fw><b>lifesrc</b></a> David Bell's Life search program, for finding new
<a href="#f4">spaceships</a> and <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>. This is a C implementation of an
algorithm developed by Dean Hickerson in 6502 assembler. Most of
the spaceships and many of the oscillators shown in this lexicon
were found with lifesrc or by Hickerson's original program.
<p>Although lifesrc itself is a command-line program, Jason Summers
has made a GUI version called <a href="#ij">WinLifeSearch</a> for Microsoft Windows.
<p>The lifesrc algorithm is only useful for very small periods, as
the amount of computing power required rises rapidly with increasing
period. For most purposes, period 7 is the practical limit with
current hardware.

<p>:<a name=sf><b>line puffer</b></a> A <a href="#z6">puffer</a> which produces its output by means of an
orthogonal line of cells at right angles to the direction of travel.
The archetypal line puffer was found by Alan Hensel in March 1994,
based on a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> found earlier that month by Hartmut Holzwart.
The following month Holzwart found a way to make extensible <i>c</i>/2 line
puffers, and Hensel found a much smaller stabilization the following
day. But in October 1995 Tim Coe discovered that for large widths
these were often unstable, although typically lasting millions of
generations. In May 1996, however, Coe found a way to fix the
instability. The resulting puffers appear to be completely stable
and to exhibit an exponential increase in period as a function of
width, although neither of these things has been proved.
<p>Line puffers have enabled the construction of various difficult
periods for <i>c</i>/2 spaceships and puffers, including occasionally
periods which are not multiples of 4 and which would therefore be
impossible to attain with the usual type of construction based on
<a href="#u3">standard spaceships</a>. (See <a href="#ff">frothing puffer</a> for another method
of constructing such periods.) In particular, the first <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#e8">rake</a>
with period not divisible by 4 was achieved in January 2000 when
David Bell constructed a p42 <a href="#mc">backrake</a> by means of line puffers.

<p>:<a name=p7><b>mosquito1</b></a> A <a href="#xb">breeder</a> constructed by Nick Gotts in September 1998.
The original version had an initial population of 103, which was
then the smallest for any known pattern with superlinear growth
(beating the record previously held by <a href="#tm">Jaws</a>). This was reduced
to 97 by Stephen Silver the following month, but was then almost
immediately superceded by <a href="#p8">mosquito2</a>.
<p>Mosquito1 consists of the classic <a href="#wm">puffer train</a> plus four
<a href="#lk">LWSS</a> and four <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> (mostly in <a href="#yj">predecessor</a> form, to keep the
population down). Once it gets going it produces a new block-laying
<a href="#x0">switch engine</a> (plus a lot of junk) every 280 generations. It is
therefore an MMS breeder, albeit a messy one.
<p>:<a name=p8><b>mosquito2</b></a> A <a href="#xb">breeder</a> constructed by Nick Gotts in October 1998.
Its initial population of 85 was for a couple of hours the smallest

<a href="#p9">mosquito3</a>.
<p>Mosquito2 is very like <a href="#p7">mosquito1</a>, but uses two fewer <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> and

later by <a href="#pa">mosquito4</a>.
<p>Mosquito3 has one less <a href="#lk">LWSS</a> than <a href="#p8">mosquito2</a>. It is somewhat
different from the earlier mosquitos in that the <a href="#x0">switch engines</a>
it makes are glider-producing rather than block-laying.
<p>:<a name=pa><b>mosquito4</b></a> A slightly improved version of <a href="#p9">mosquito3</a> which Stephen
Silver produced in October 1998 making use of another discovery of
Nick Gotts (September 1997): an 8-cell pattern that evolves into a
<a href="#lk">LWSS</a> plus some junk. Mosquito4 is a <a href="#xb">breeder</a> with an initial
population of 73, at the time the smallest for any known pattern
with superlinear growth, but superceded a few days later by
<a href="#pb">mosquito5</a>.
<p>:<a name=pb><b>mosquito5</b></a> A slightly improved version of <a href="#pa">mosquito4</a> which Nick Gotts

creates a <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> travelling in the opposite direction. Together
with some reactions found by Dieter Leithner, and a LWSS-turning
reaction which Rott had found in November 1993 (but which was not
widely known until Paul Callahan rediscovered it in June 1994)
this can be used to prove that there exist <a href="#i7">gliderless</a> guns for
LWSS, MWSS and <a href="#lg">HWSS</a> for every period that is a multiple of 46.

Dave Buckingham (October 1996) that describes his discovery of

<p>:<a name=tt><b>omniperiodic</b></a> A <a href="#g6">cellular automaton</a> is said to be
omniperiodic if it has <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> of all <a href="#ek">periods</a>.
It is not known if Life is omniperiodic, although this seems
likely. Dave Buckingham's work on Herschel conduits in 1996
(see <a href="#yq">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>)
reduced the number of unresolved cases to a finite number.
At the time of writing the only periods for which no oscillator is
known are 19, 23, 31, 37, 38, 41, 43 and 53. If we insist that the
oscillator must contain a cell oscillating at the full period, then
34 and 51 should be added to this list. The most recently achieved
periods were all found by Noam Elkies: p49 in August 1999 (a glider
loop using p7 <a href="#wk">reflectors</a> built from his new p7 <a href="#es">pipsquirter</a>),
p39 (previously only possible without a p39 cell) in July 2000, and

the most <a href="#cs">natural</a> <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> of period greater than 3. In fact
it is the fifth or sixth most common <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> overall, being

<p><a href='cells/pentoad.cells'><img src='cells/pentoad.png' width='114' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=m7><b>pentomino</b></a> Any 5-cell <a href="#kv">polyomino</a>. There are 12 such patterns,
and Conway assigned them all letters in the range O to Z, loosely
based on their shapes. Only in the case of the <a href="#t2">R-pentomino</a>
has Conway's label remained in common use, but all of them can
nonetheless be found in this lexicon.
<p>:<a name=ek><b>period</b></a> The smallest number of generations it takes for an
<a href="#wu">oscillator</a> or <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> to reappear in its original form. The
term can also be used for a <a href="#z6">puffer</a>, <a href="#qb">wick</a>, <a href="#ai">fuse</a>, <a href="#sl">superstring</a>,
stream of <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>, <a href="#z8">factory</a> or <a href="#gv">gun</a>. In the last case there
is a distinction between <a href="#ho">true</a> period and <a href="#ti">pseudo</a> period. There
is also a somewhat different concept of period for <a href="#sg">wicktrailers</a>.
<p>:<a name=q7><b>perturb</b></a> To change the fate of an object by reacting it with
other objects. Typically, the other objects are sparks from
<a href="#f4">spaceships</a> or <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>, or are <a href="#yy">eaters</a> or impacting
spaceships. Perturbations are typically done to turn a <a href="#q8">dirty</a>
reaction into a <a href="#bx">clean</a> one, or to change the products of a reaction.
In many desirable cases the perturbing objects are not destroyed by
the reaction, or else are easily replenished.
<p>:<a name=qh><b>perturbation</b></a> See <a href="#q7">perturb</a>.
<p>:<a name=qr><b>phase</b></a> A representative generation of a periodic object such as an
<a href="#wu">oscillator</a> or <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>. The number of phases is equal to the
<a href="#ek">period</a> of the object. The phases of an object usually repeat in
the same cyclic sequence forever, although some <a href="#qh">perturbations</a> can
cause a <a href="#nw">phase change</a>.
<p>:<a name=nw><b>phase change</b></a> A <a href="#qh">perturbation</a> of a periodic object which causes the
object to skip ahead by one or more <a href="#qr">phases</a>. If the perturbation
is repeated indefinitely, this can effectively change the <a href="#ek">period</a>
of the object. An example of this, found by Dean Hickerson in
November 1998, is shown below. In this example, the period of the
<a href="#wu">oscillator</a> would be 7 if the <a href="#d8">mold</a> were removed, but the period
is increased to 8 because of the repeated phase changes caused by
the mold's <a href="#ks">spark</a>.
<p><a href='cells/phase_change.cells'><img src='cells/phase_change.png' width='130' height='98'></a></p>
The following pattern demonstrates a p4 <i>c</i>/2 <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> found
by Jason Summers, in which the phase is changed as it deletes a
<a href="#g5">forward glider</a>. This phase change allows the spaceship to be
used to delete a glider wave produced by a <a href="#e8">rake</a> whose period is
2 (mod 4).
<p><a href='cells/phase_change2.cells'><img src='cells/phase_change2.png' width='298' height='210'></a></p>
<p>Phase changing reactions have enabled the construction of
spaceships having periods that were otherwise unknown, and also allow
the construction of period-doubling and period-tripling <a href="#l5">convoys</a> to
easily produce very high period rakes.

<p>:<b>phi</b> The following common <a href="#ks">spark</a>. The name comes from the shape in
the generation after the one shown here.

<p>:<a name=wd><b>phoenix</b></a> Any pattern all of whose cells die in every generation,
but which never dies as a whole. A <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> cannot be a phoenix,
and in fact every finite phoenix eventually evolves into an
<a href="#wu">oscillator</a>. The following 12-cell oscillator (found by the MIT
group in December 1971) is the smallest known phoenix, and is
sometimes called simply "the phoenix".
<p><a href='cells/phoenix.cells'><img src='cells/phoenix.png' width='74' height='74'></a></p>
Every known phoenix oscillator has period 2. In January 2000,
Stephen Silver showed that a period 3 oscillator cannot be a
phoenix. The situation for higher periods is unknown.
<p>:<b>pi</b> = <a href="#hg">pi-heptomino</a>
<p>:<a name=hg><b>pi-heptomino</b></a> (stabilizes at time 173) A common pattern. The name is

is orientated parallel to the direction from which it is produced
(in contrast to domino sparkers like the <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a> and

<p>:<b>pixel</b> = <a href="#vu">cell</a>
<p>:<b>plet</b> = <a href="#k8">polyplet</a>
<p>:<a name=kv><b>polyomino</b></a> A finite collection of orthogonally connected cells. The
mathematical study of polyominoes was initiated by Solomon Golomb
in 1953. Conway's early investigations of Life and other cellular
automata involved tracking the histories of small polyominoes,
this being a reasonable way to ascertain the typical behaviour of
different cellular automata when the patterns had to be evolved
by hand rather than by computer. Polyominoes have no special
significance in Life, but their extensive study during the early
years lead to a number of important discoveries and has influenced
the terminology of Life. (Note on spelling: As with "dominoes"
the plural may also be spelt without an e. In this lexicon I have
followed Golomb in using the longer form.)
<p>It is possible for a polyomino to be an <a href="#wu">oscillator</a>. In fact
there are infinitely many examples of such polyominoes, namely the
<a href="#an">cross</a> and its larger analogues. The only other known examples
are the <a href="#k1">block</a>, the <a href="#dw">blinker</a>, the <a href="#dn">toad</a>, the <a href="#q1">star</a> and (in two
different phases) the <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a>.
<p>A polyomino can also be a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>, as the <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>, <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> and
<a href="#lg">HWSS</a> show.
<p>:<a name=k8><b>polyplet</b></a> A finite collection of orthogonally or diagonally connected

different p30 <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> in which a <a href="#fv">pre-pulsar</a> is
pushed by a pair of <a href="#ja">spiders</a>. The back sparks of the spaceship can
be used to perturb gliders in many different ways, allowing the easy
construction of <i>c</i>/5 puffers. The first PPS was found by David Bell
in May 1998 based on a p15 pre-pulsar spaceship found by Noam Elkies
in December 1997. See also <a href="#x1">SPPS</a> and <a href="#wh">APPS</a>.

other means the replication of the pre-pulsar can be made to occur
in just 14 generations as half of it is eaten; this allows the
construction of p28 and p29 oscillators, and is in fact the only
known method for creating a p29 oscillator. The pre-pulsar is also
a vital component of the only known p47 oscillator.

<p>:<a name=z6><b>puffer</b></a> An object that moves like a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>, except that it
leaves debris behind. The first known puffers were found by Bill
Gosper and travelled at <i>c</i>/2 orthogonally (see diagram below for
the very first one, found in 1971). Not long afterwards <i>c</i>/12
diagonal puffers were found (see <a href="#x0">switch engine</a>). Discounting
<a href="#h4">wickstretchers</a> (which are not puffers in the conventional sense),
no new velocity was obtained after this until David Bell found the
first <i>c</i>/3 orthogonal puffer in April 1996. Since then <i>c</i>/5 orthogonal
puffers have also been found, the first by Tim Coe in May 1997.
Jason Summers built the first <i>c</i>/4 orthogonal puffer in January 1999,
and the first 2<i>c</i>/5 orthogonal puffer in February 1999.

<p>:<a name=pm><b>puffer engine</b></a> A pattern which can be used as the main component of
a <a href="#z6">puffer</a>. The pattern may itself be a puffer (e.g. the classic
<a href="#wm">puffer train</a>), it may be a spaceship (e.g. the <a href="#j0">Schick engine</a>),
or it may even be unstable (e.g. the <a href="#x0">switch engine</a>).
<p>:<a name=wm><b>puffer train</b></a> The full name for a <a href="#z6">puffer</a>, coined by Conway before
any examples were known. The term was also applied specifically
to the classic puffer train found by Bill Gosper and shown below.
This is very <a href="#q8">dirty</a>, and the tail does not stabilize until
generation 5533. It consists of a <a href="#k0">B-heptomino</a> (shown here one
generation before the standard form) escorted by two <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>. (This
was the second known puffer. The first is shown under <a href="#z6">puffer</a>.)

<p>:<a name=t3><b>puff suppressor</b></a> An attachment at the back of a <a href="#sf">line puffer</a> that
suppresses all or some of its puffing action. The example below (by
Hartmut Holzwart) has a 3-cell puff suppressor at the back which
suppresses the entire puff, making a p2 <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>. If you delete
this puff suppressor then you get a p60 double <a href="#p5">beehive</a> <a href="#z6">puffer</a>.

<p>:<b>pulse</b> A moving object, such as a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> or <a href="#ra">Herschel</a>, which
can be used to transmit information. See <a href="#t5">pulse divider</a>.
<p>Also another name for a <a href="#ds">pulsar quadrant</a>.
<p>:<a name=t5><b>pulse divider</b></a> A mechanism that lets every <i>n</i>-th object that reaches
it pass through, and deletes all the rest, where <i>n</i> &gt; 1 and the

<p>The following diagram shows a p5 glider pulse divider by Dieter
Leithner (February 1998). The first glider moves the centre block
and is reflected at 90 degrees. The next glider to come along will
not be reflected, but will move the block back to its original
position. The small size and low period of this example make it
useful for constructing glider <a href="#gv">guns</a> of certain periods. p7, p22,
p36 and p46 versions of this pulse divider are also known.

<p><a href='cells/queen_bee_shuttle.cells'><img src='cells/queen_bee_shuttle.png' width='186' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=as><b>Quetzal</b></a> Dieter Leithner's name for the <a href="#ho">true</a> p54 glider gun he built
in January 1998. (This is short for <a href="#kn">Quetzalcoatlus</a> and expresses
the fact that the gun was a very large <a href="#ba">Herschel loop</a> that was not
an <a href="#wi">emu</a>.) Shortly afterwards Leithner also built a p56 Quetzal
using a mechanism found by Noam Elkies for this purpose. In October
1998 Stephen Silver constructed a p55 Quetzal using Elkies' p5
<a href="#wk">reflector</a> of the previous month.
<p>Some of the more recent Quetzals are not Herschel loops, but are
instead short Herschel tracks firing several glider streams all but
one of which is reflected back to the beginning of the track to
create a new Herschel. Noam Elkies first had the idea of doing
this for the p55 case, and Stephen Silver constructed the resulting
gun shortly after building the original (much larger) p55 Quetzal.
Jason Summers later built a p54 version, which is more complicated
because the evenness of the period makes the timing problems
considerably more difficult.
<p>:<a name=kn><b>Quetzalcoatlus</b></a> A giant flying dinosaur after which Dieter Leithner
named his p54 gun. Usually abbreviated to <a href="#as">Quetzal</a>, or simply Q
(as in Q54, Q55, Q56, Q-gun, etc.).

<p>:<a name=s4><b>R2D2</b></a> (p8) This was found, in the form shown below, by Peter Raynham
in the early 1970s. The name derives from a form with a larger
and less symmetric <a href="#c9">stator</a> discovered by Noam Elkies in August
1994. Compare with <a href="#bc">Gray counter</a>.

Trevorrow in 1986.
<p><a href='cells/rabbits.cells'><img src='cells/rabbits.png' width='66' height='34'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=e8><b>rake</b></a> Any <a href="#z6">puffer</a> whose debris consists of <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>. A rake is
said to be forwards, backwards or sideways according to the direction
of the spaceships relative to the direction of the rake. Originally
the term "rake" was applied only to forwards <i>c</i>/2 glider puffers (see
<a href="#yp">space rake</a>). Many people prefer not to use the term in the case
where the puffed spaceships travel parallel or anti-parallel to the
puffer, as in this case they do not rake out any significant region
of the Life plane (and, in contrast to true rakes, these puffers
cannot travel in a stream, and so could never be produced by a
<a href="#gv">gun</a>).
<p>Although the first rakes (circa 1971) were <i>c</i>/2, rakes of other
velocities have since been built. Dean Hickerson's construction of
<a href="#x6">Corderships</a> in 1991 made it easy for <i>c</i>/12 diagonal rakes to be
built, although no one actually did this until 1998, by which time
David Bell had constructed <i>c</i>/3 and <i>c</i>/5 rakes (May 1996 and September
1997, respectively). Jason Summers constructed a 2<i>c</i>/5 rake in June
2000 (building on work by Paul Tooke and David Bell) and a <i>c</i>/4
orthogonal rake in October 2000 (based largely on reactions found
by David Bell).
<p>The smallest possible period for a rake is probably 7, as this
could be achieved by a 3<i>c</i>/7 orthogonal backwards glider puffer. The
smallest period attained to date is 8 (Jason Summers, March 2001) -
see <a href="#mc">backrake</a>.

<p>:<b>R-bee</b> = <a href="#gq">bun</a>
<p>:<b>receiver</b> See <a href="#ee">Herschel receiver</a>.
<p>:<a name=wk><b>reflector</b></a> Any <a href="#h3">stable</a> or oscillating pattern that can reflect some
type of <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> (usually a <a href="#bf">glider</a>) without suffering permanent
damage. The first known reflector was the <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a>, which
functions as a 180-degree glider reflector (see <a href="#yo">relay</a>). Other
examples include the <a href="#fh">buckaroo</a>, the <a href="#my">twin bees shuttle</a> and some
oscillators based on the <a href="#so">traffic jam</a> reaction. Glider <a href="#gv">guns</a> can
also be made into reflectors, although these are mostly rather large.
<p>In September 1998 Noam Elkies found some fast small-period glider
reflectors. The p8 version is shown below. Replacing the <a href="#f8">figure-8</a>
by the p6 <a href="#es">pipsquirter</a> gives a p6 version. A more complicated
construction allows a p5 version (which, as had been anticipated,
soon led to a <a href="#ho">true</a> p55 gun - see <a href="#as">Quetzal</a>). And in August 1999
Elkies found a suitable p7 <a href="#w7">sparker</a>, allowing the first p49
oscillator to be constructed.
<p><a href='cells/reflector.cells'><img src='cells/reflector.png' width='146' height='122'></a></p>
<p>Stable reflectors are special in that if they satisfy certain
conditions they can be used to construct <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> of all
sufficiently large periods. It was known for some time that stable
reflectors were possible (see <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>), but no one
was able to construct an explicit example until Paul Callahan did
so in October 1996.
<p>All known stable reflectors are very slow. Callahan's original
reflector has a <a href="#oz">repeat time</a> of 4840, soon improved to 1686 and
then 894 and then 850. In November 1996 Dean Hickerson found a
variant in which this is reduced to 747. Dave Buckingham reduced
it to 672 in May 1997 using a somewhat different method, and in
October 1997 Stephen Silver reduced it to 623 by a method closer
to the original. In November 1998 Callahan reduced this to 575
with a new initial reaction. A small modification by Silver a few
days later brought this down to 497.
<p>But in April 2001 Dave Greene found a 180-degree stable reflector
with a repeat time of only 202 (see <a href="#jc">boojum reflector</a>). This
reflector also won the $100 prize that Dieter Leithner had offered
in April 1997 for the first stable reflector to fit in a 50&times;50 box,
and the additional $100 that Alan Hensel had offered in January 1999
for the same feat. Dave Greene has subsequently offered $50 for the
first 90-degree stable glider reflector that fits in a 50&times;50 box, and
a further $50 for the first in a 35&times;35 box.

travel in a loop. The simplest example is the p60 one shown below
using two <a href="#af">pentadecathlons</a>. Pulling the pentadecathlons further

between the arrival of one object and the arrival of the next. This
term is used for things such as <a href="#wk">reflectors</a> or <a href="#l7">conduits</a> and the
objects (gliders or Herschels, for example) will interact fatally
with each other (or one will interact fatally with a disturbance

but does not tend to infinity. (In other words, the population
reaches new heights infinitely often, but also infinitely often
drops below some fixed value.) The first such pattern was
constructed by Dean Hickerson in April 1991. Conway's preferred
plural is "sawteeth".

<p><a href='cells/siesta.cells'><img src='cells/siesta.png' width='138' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<b>signal</b> Movement of information through the Life universe. Signals
can be carried by <a href="#f4">spaceships</a>, <a href="#ai">fuses</a>, <a href="#nn">drifters</a>, or <a href="#l7">conduits</a>.
Spaceships can only transfer a signal at the speed of the
spaceship, while fuses can transfer a signal at speeds up to the
<a href="#lw">speed of light</a>.
<p>In practice, many signals are encoded as the presence or absence
of a <a href="#bf">glider</a> (or other spaceship) at a particular point at a
particular time. Such signals can be combined by the collision of
gliders to form logic operations such as AND, OR, and NOT gates.
Signals can be duplicated using <a href="#z7">glider duplicators</a> or other
<a href="#cw">fanout</a> devices, and can be used up by causing <a href="#qh">perturbations</a>
on other parts of the Life object.
<p>Signals are used in <a href="#jr">pseudo-random glider generators</a>, the
<a href="#fg">unit Life cell</a> and the <a href="#gd">Fermat prime calculator</a>, among others.

<p>:<a name=ct><b>slide gun</b></a> A <a href="#gv">gun</a> which fires sideways from an extending arm. The
arm consists of streams of <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> which are pushing a pattern
away from the body of the gun and releasing an output spaceship every
time they do so. Each output spaceship therefore travels along a
different path.
<p>Dieter Leithner constructed the first slide gun in July 1994
(although he used the term "side shooting gun"). The following
pattern shows the key reaction of this slide gun. The three gliders
shown will push the block one cell diagonally, thereby extending the
length of the arm by one cell, and at the same time they release an
output glider sideways. (In 1999, Jason Summers constructed slide
guns using other reactions.)
<p><a href='cells/slide_gun.cells'><img src='cells/slide_gun.png' width='146' height='170'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=oy><b>sliding block memory</b></a> A memory register whose value is stored as the
position of a <a href="#k1">block</a>. The block can be moved by means of <a href="#bf">glider</a>
collisions - see <a href="#cd">block pusher</a> for an example.
<p>In Conway's original formulation (as part of his proof of the
existence of a <a href="#z5">universal computer</a> in Life) 2 gliders were used to
pull the block inwards by three diagonal spaces, and 30 gliders were
used to push it out by the same amount. Dean Hickerson later greatly
improved on this, finding a way to pull a block inwards by one
diagonal space using 2 gliders, and push it out using 3 gliders.
In order for the memory to be of any use there also has to be a way
to read the value held. It suffices to be able to check whether
the value is zero (as Conway did), or to be able to detect the
transition from one to zero (as Hickerson did).
<p>Dean Hickerson's sliding block memory is used in Paul Chapman's
<a href="#q6">URM</a>.

<p>:<b>SMM breeder</b> See <a href="#xb">breeder</a>.
<p>:<a name=ea><b>smoke</b></a> Debris which is fairly long-lived but eventually dies
completely. Basically, a large <a href="#ks">spark</a>. This term is used
especially when talking about the output from a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> -
see <a href="#dl">smoking ship</a>.
<p>:<a name=dl><b>smoking ship</b></a> A <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> which produces <a href="#ea">smoke</a>. If the smoke
extends past the edge of the rest of the spaceship, then it can be
used to perturb other objects as the spaceship passes by. Running
gliders into the smoke is often a good way to turn or duplicate the
them, or convert them into other objects. Sometimes the smoke from
a smoking ship may itself be perturbed by accompanying spaceships in
order to form a <a href="#z6">puffer</a>. A simple example of a smoking ship is the
<a href="#j0">Schick engine</a>.
<p>:<a name=ol><b>snacker</b></a> (p9) Found by Mark Niemiec in 1972. This is a

<p><a href='cells/snacker.cells'><img src='cells/snacker.png' width='170' height='98'></a></p>
The stabilizers make the <a href="#e0">domino</a> spark largely inaccessible, but the
snacker is extensible, as shown in the next diagram, and so a more
accessible p9 domino spark can be obtained. In April 1998 Dean
Hickerson found an alternative stabilizer that is less obtrusive than
the original one, and this is also shown in this diagram.
<p><a href='cells/snacker2.cells'><img src='cells/snacker2.png' width='282' height='98'></a></p>

<p>It is known that there exist spaceships travelling in all
rational directions and at arbitrarily slow speeds (see
<a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>). Before 1989, however, the only known
examples travelled at <i>c</i>/4 diagonally (gliders) or <i>c</i>/2 orthogonally
(everything else). In 1989 Dean Hickerson started to use automated
searches to look for new spaceships, and had considerable success.
Other people have continued these searches using tools such as
<a href="#fw">lifesrc</a> and <a href="#gm">gfind</a>, and as a result we now have a great variety
of spaceships travelling at ten different velocities. The following
table details the discovery of spaceships with new velocities.

<p>In addition, Jason Summers has put together a fairly detailed
description of how to build a 17<i>c</i>/45 spaceship, although the
construction has not yet been carried out. See <a href="#q2">17c/45 spaceship</a>
for more details.
<p>A period <i>p</i> spaceship which displaces itself (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>) during its
period, where <i>m</i>&gt;=<i>n</i>, is said to be of type (<i>m</i>,<i>n</i>)/<i>p</i>. It was proved by
Conway in 1970 that <i>p</i>&gt;=2<i>m</i>+2<i>n</i>. (This follows immediately from the
easily-proved fact that a pattern cannot advance diagonally at a rate
greater than one half diagonal step every other generation.)
<p>The following diagram shows the only known <i>c</i>/5 diagonal spaceship
(Jason Summers, November 2000).

<p>:<b>Spaceships in Conway's Life</b> A series of articles posted by David
Bell to the newsgroup comp.theory.cell-automata during the period
August-October 1992 that described many of the new <a href="#f4">spaceships</a> found
by himself, Dean Hickerson and Hartmut Holzwart. Bell produced an
addendum covering more recent developments in 1996.
<p>:<a name=ks><b>spark</b></a> A pattern that dies. The term is typically used to describe
a collection of cells periodically thrown off by an <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> or
<a href="#f4">spaceship</a>, but other dying patterns, particulary those consisting
or only one or two cells (such as produced by certain glider
collisions, for example), are also described as sparks. For
examples of small sparks see <a href="#ya">unix</a> and <a href="#lg">HWSS</a>. For an example
of a much larger spark see <a href="#j0">Schick engine</a>.

<p>:<a name=ld><b>sparse Life</b></a> This refers to the study of the evolution of a
Life universe which starts off as a random <a href="#gu">soup</a> of extremely
low density. Such a universe is dominated at an early stage
by <a href="#k1">blocks</a> and <a href="#dw">blinkers</a> (often referred to collectively
as <a href="#eq">blonks</a>) in a ratio of about 2:1. Much later it will be
dominated by simple <a href="#cy">infinite growth</a> patterns (presumably mostly
<a href="#x0">switch engines</a>). The long-term fate of a sparse Life universe is
less certain. It may possibly become dominated by self-reproducing
patterns (see <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>), but it is not at all clear
that there is any mechanism for these to deal with the all junk
produced by switch engines.
<p>:<a name=lw><b>speed of light</b></a> A speed of one cell per generation, the greatest

(see <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~dean/RLE/stamps.html">http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~dean/RLE/stamps.html</a>).
<p>:<a name=u3><b>standard spaceship</b></a> A <a href="#bf">glider</a>, <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>, <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> or <a href="#lg">HWSS</a>. These have
all been known since 1970.
<p>:<a name=q1><b>star</b></a> (p3) Found by Hartmut Holzwart, February 1993.
<p><a href='cells/star.cells'><img src='cells/star.png' width='98' height='98'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=xh><b>star gate</b></a> A device by Dieter Leithner (October 1996) for transporting
a <a href="#lk">LWSS</a> faster than the <a href="#lw">speed of light</a>. The key reaction is the
<a href="#uo">Fast Forward Force Field</a>.
<p>:<a name=c9><b>stator</b></a> The cells of an <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> that are always on. Compare
<a href="#e5">rotor</a>. (The stator is sometimes taken to include also some of
those cells which are always off.) The stator is divided into the
<a href="#ro">bushing</a> and the <a href="#c2">casing</a>.
<p>By analogy, the cells of an <a href="#yy">eater</a> that remain on even when the
eater is eating are considered to constitute the stator of the eater.
This is not necessarily well-defined, because the eater may have more
than one eating action.
<p>:<a name=xy><b>step</b></a> Another term for a <a href="#su">generation</a>. This term is particularly
used in describing <a href="#l7">conduits</a>. For example, a 64-step conduit is
one through which the active object takes 64 generations to pass.
<p>:<a name=q3><b>stillater</b></a> (p3) Found by Robert Wainwright, September 1985. This is
one of only three essentially different p3 <a href="#wu">oscillators</a> with only
three cells in the <a href="#e5">rotor</a>. The others are <a href="#gk">1-2-3</a> and <a href="#fr">cuphook</a>.
<p><a href='cells/stillater.cells'><img src='cells/stillater.png' width='74' height='74'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=nu><b>still life</b></a> Any <a href="#h3">stable</a> pattern, usually assumed to be finite
and nonempty. For the purposes of enumerating still lifes this
definition is, however, unsatisfactory because, for example, any
pair of blocks would count as a still life, and there would therefore
be an infinite number of 8-bit still lifes. For this reason a
stricter definition is often used, counting a stable pattern as a
single still life only if its <a href="#lt">islands</a> cannot be divided into two
nonempty sets both of which are stable in their own right. Compare
<a href="#ah">pseudo still life</a>.
<p>The requirement that a still life not be decomposable into two
separate stable patterns may seem a bit arbitrary, as it does not
rule out the possibility that it might be decomposable into more
than two. This is shown by the patterns in the following diagram,
both found by Gabriel Nivasch in July 2001. On the left is a 32-cell
pattern that can be broken down into three stable pieces but not into
two. On the right is a 34-cell pattern that can be broken down into
four stable pieces but not into two or three. (Note that, as a
consequence of the Four-Colour Theorem, four is as high as you need
ever go.) It is arguable that patterns like these ought not to be
considered as single still lifes.
<p><a href='cells/still_life.cells'><img src='cells/still_life.png' width='186' height='90'></a></p>
<p>Still lifes have been enumerated by Conway (4-7 bits), Robert
Wainwright (8-10 bits), Dave Buckingham (11-13 bits), Peter Raynham
(14 bits) and Mark Niemiec (15-24 bits). The resulting figures are
shown below. (These figures shouldn't be affected by the above
discussion of the strict definition of "still life", because it is
unlikely that there are any doubtful cases with much less than 32
cells.)

<p>:<a name=gs><b>still life tagalong</b></a> A <a href="#kd">tagalong</a> which takes the form of a
<a href="#nu">still life</a> in at least one <a href="#qr">phase</a>. An example is shown below.
<p><a href='cells/still_life_tagalong.cells'><img src='cells/still_life_tagalong.png' width='162' height='146'></a></p>
<p>:<b>stretcher</b> Any pattern that grows by stretching a <a href="#qb">wick</a> or <a href="#ag">agar</a>.
See <a href="#h4">wickstretcher</a> and <a href="#ux">spacefiller</a>.
<p>:<a name=qv><b>strict volatility</b></a> A term suggested by Noam Elkies in August 1998
for the proportion of cells involved in a period <i>n</i> <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> which
themselves oscillate with period <i>n</i>. For prime <i>n</i> this is the same
as the ordinary <a href="#ps">volatility</a>.
<p>:<b>super beehive</b> = <a href="#ly">honeycomb</a>
<p>:<b>superfountain</b> (p4) This <a href="#w7">sparker</a> was found by Noam Elkies in
February 1998 (shown here with a slightly smaller <a href="#c9">stator</a>).
The resulting <a href="#ks">spark</a> is more isolated than in the <a href="#db">fountain</a>.
<p><a href='cells/superfountain.cells'><img src='cells/superfountain.png' width='378' height='210'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=sl><b>superstring</b></a> An infinite orthogonal row of cells stabilized on one
side so that it moves at the <a href="#lw">speed of light</a>, often leaving debris
behind. The first examples were found in 1971 by Edward Fitzgerald
and Robert Wainwright. Superstrings were studied extensively
by Peter Rott during 1992-1994, and he found examples with many
different periods. (But no odd periods. In August 1998 Stephen
Silver proved that odd-period superstrings are impossible.)
<p>Sometimes a finite section of a superstring can be made to run
between two tracks ("waveguides"). This gives a <a href="#ai">fuse</a> which can
be made as wide as desired. The first example was found by Tony
Smithurst and uses <a href="#t7">tubs</a>. (This is shown below. The superstring
itself is p4 with a repeating section of width 9 producing one
blinker per period and was one of those discovered in 1971. With
the track in place, however, the period is 8. This track can also
be used with a number of other superstrings.) Shortly after seeing
this example, in March 1997 Peter Rott found another superstring
track consisting of <a href="#ci">boats</a>. At present these are the only two
waveguides known. Both are destroyed by the superstring as it
moves along - it would be interesting to find one that remains
intact.
<p>See <a href="#wn">titanic toroidal traveler</a> for another example of a
superstring.

<p>:<b>support</b> Those parts of an object which are only present in order to
keep the rest of the object (such an <a href="#xo">engine</a> or an edge <a href="#ks">spark</a>)
working correctly. These can be components of the object, or else
accompanying objects used to <a href="#q7">perturb</a> the object. In many cases
there is a wide variation of support possible for an engine. The
<a href="#wv">arms</a> in many <a href="#z6">puffers</a> are an example of support.
<p>:<b>surprise</b> (p3) Found by Dave Buckingham, November 1972.
<p><a href='cells/surprise.cells'><img src='cells/surprise.png' width='90' height='82'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=s6><b>swan</b></a> (<i>c</i>/4 diagonally, p4) A diagonal <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> producing some
useful sparks (see <a href="#qz">boatstretcher</a> for one simple use). Found
by Tim Coe in February 1996.
<p><a href='cells/swan.cells'><img src='cells/swan.png' width='202' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=x0><b>switch engine</b></a> The following pattern, which in itself is unstable,
but which can be used to make <i>c</i>/12 diagonal <a href="#z6">puffers</a> and
<a href="#f4">spaceships</a>.
<p><a href='cells/switch_engine.cells'><img src='cells/switch_engine.png' width='58' height='42'></a></p>
<p>The switch engine was discovered by Charles Corderman in 1971.
He also found the two basic types of stabilized switch engine:
a p288 block-laying type (the more common of the two) and p384
glider-producing type. These two puffers are the most <a href="#cs">natural</a>
infinite growth patterns in Life, being the only ones ever seen
to occur from random starting patterns.
<p>Patterns giving rise to block-laying switch engines can be seen
under <a href="#cy">infinite growth</a>, and one giving rise to a glider-producing
switch engine is shown under <a href="#r7">time bomb</a>. See also <a href="#x6">Cordership</a>

<p>:<b>tag</b> = <a href="#kd">tagalong</a>
<p>:<a name=kd><b>tagalong</b></a> An object which is not a <a href="#f4">spaceship</a> in its own right, but
which can be attached to one or more spaceships to form a larger
spaceship. For examples see <a href="#b9">Canada goose</a>, <a href="#u0">fly</a>, <a href="#ws">pushalong</a>,
<a href="#g2">sidecar</a> and <a href="#aw">sparky</a>. See also <a href="#j0">Schick engine</a>, which consists of
a tagalong attached to two LWSS (or similar).
<p>:<a name=r9><b>tail spark</b></a> A <a href="#ks">spark</a> at the back of a spaceship. For example, the
1-bit spark at the back of a <a href="#lk">LWSS</a>, <a href="#ll">MWSS</a> or <a href="#lg">HWSS</a> in their less
dense phases.
<p>:<a name=gl><b>tame</b></a> To <a href="#q7">perturb</a> a <a href="#q8">dirty</a> reaction using other patterns so as to
make it <a href="#bx">clean</a> and hopefully useful. Or to make a reaction work
which would otherwise fail due to unwanted products which interfere
with the reaction.

<p>:<b>technician finished product</b> = <a href="#ot">technician</a>
<p>:<a name=lf><b>teeth</b></a> A 65-cell quadratic growth pattern found by Nick Gotts in March
2000. This (and a related 65-cell pattern which Gotts found at about
the same time) beat the record previously held by <a href="#pb">mosquito5</a> for
smallest population known to have superlinear growth. Now superceded
by <a href="#hf">catacryst</a> and <a href="#p2">metacatacryst</a>.
<p>:<b>ternary reaction</b> Any reaction between three objects. In particular,
a reaction in which two gliders from one stream and one glider from
a crossing stream of the same period annihilate each other. This
can be used to combine two glider guns of the same period to produce
a new glider gun with double the period.

<p>:<b>tetraplet</b> Any 4-cell <a href="#k8">polyplet</a>.
<p>:<b>tetromino</b> Any 4-cell <a href="#kv">polyomino</a>. There are five such objects,

<p>:<a name=lb><b>The Recursive Universe</b></a> A popular science book by William
Poundstone (1985) dealing with the nature of the universe,
illuminated by parallels with the game of Life. This book
brought to a wider audience many of the results that first
appeared in <a href="#j8">LifeLine</a>. It also outlines the proof of the
existence of a <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a> in Life first given
in <a href="#v3">Winning Ways</a>.
<p>:<b>thumb</b> A <a href="#ks">spark</a>-like protrusion which flicks out in a manner
resembling a thumb being flicked.
<p>Here are two examples. On the left is a p9 thumb sparker
found by Dean Hickerson in October 1998. On the right is a

<p>:<b>tie</b> A term used in naming certain <a href="#nu">still lifes</a> (and the <a href="#c9">stator</a>
part of certain <a href="#wu">oscillators</a>). It indicates that the object
consists of two smaller objects joined point to point, as in

<p><a href='cells/toad.cells'><img src='cells/toad.png' width='42' height='26'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=kb><b>toad-flipper</b></a> A <a href="#dn">toad</a> <a href="#ua">hassler</a> that works in the manner of the

apply their <a href="#ks">sparks</a> to the toad in order to flip it over. When the
sparks are applied again it is flipped back. Either or both domino
sparkers can be moved down two spaces from the position shown and
the toad-flipper will still work, but because of symmetry there are
really only two different types. Compare <a href="#a5">toad-sucker</a>.

<p><a href='cells/toaster.cells'><img src='cells/toaster.png' width='130' height='106'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=rx><b>torus</b></a> As applies to Life, usually means a finite Life universe
which takes the form of an <i>m</i> &times; <i>n</i> rectangle with the bottom edge
considered to be joined to the top edge and the left edge joined
to the right edge, so that the universe is topologically a torus.
There are also other less obvious ways of obtaining an toroidal
universe.
<p>See also <a href="#yl">Klein bottle</a>.
<p>:<a name=zj><b>total aperiodic</b></a> Any finite pattern which evolves in such a way that
no cell in the Life plane is eventually periodic. The first example
was found by Bill Gosper in November 1997. A few days later he found
the following much smaller example consisting of three copies of a
p12 <a href="#mc">backrake</a> by Dave Buckingham.

<p><a href='cells/traffic_circle.cells'><img src='cells/traffic_circle.png' width='394' height='394'></a></p>
<p>:<a name=so><b>traffic jam</b></a> Any <a href="#mo">traffic light</a> <a href="#ua">hassler</a>, such as <a href="#mz">traffic circle</a>.
The term is also applied to the following reaction, used in most
traffic light hasslers, in which two traffic lights interact in such
a way as to reappear after 25 generations with an extra 6 spaces
between them.
<p><a href='cells/traffic_jam.cells'><img src='cells/traffic_jam.png' width='138' height='74'></a></p>

<p>:<a name=mm><b>transparent block reaction</b></a> A certain reaction between a block and
a <a href="#ra">Herschel</a> <a href="#yj">predecessor</a> in which the block reappears in its
original place some time later, the reaction having effectively
passed through it. This reaction was found by Dave Buckingham in
1988. It has been used in some <a href="#zs">Herschel conduits</a>, and in the
<a href="#xm">gunstars</a>. Because the reaction involves a Herschel predecessor
rather than an actual Herschel, the following diagram shows instead
a <a href="#k0">B-heptomino</a> (which by itself would evolve into a block and a
Herschel).

<a href="#f4">spaceships</a> (or <a href="#e8">rakes</a>) is said to be a true period <i>n</i> gun if
its mechanism oscillates with period <i>n</i>. (The same distinction
between true and pseudo also exists for <a href="#z6">puffers</a>.) True period
<i>n</i> guns are known to exist for all periods greater than 61 (see
<a href="#yq">My Experience with B-heptominos in Oscillators</a>), but only a
few smaller periods have been achieved, namely 22, 24, 30, 44,
46, 48, 50, 54, 55, 56 and 60. (Credits for these small period
guns are: p30, p46 and p60 by Bill Gosper in 1970-1971, p44 by

<p>:<a name=fg><b>unit Life cell</b></a> A rectangular pattern, of size greater than 1&times;1,
that can simulate Life in the following sense. The pattern
by itself represents a dead Life cell, and some other pattern
represents a live Life cell. When the plane is tiled by these
two patterns (which then represent the state of a whole Life
universe) they evolve, after a fixed amount of time, into another
tiling of the plane by the same two patterns which correctly
represents the Life generation following the one they initially
represented. It is usual to use capital letters for the simulated
things, so, for example, for the first known unit Life cell
(constructed by David Bell in January 1996), one Generation is
5760 generations, and one Cell is 500&times;500 cells.
<p>:<a name=z5><b>universal computer</b></a> A computer that can compute anything that is
computable. (The concept of computability can be defined in terms
of Turing machines, or by Church's lambda calculus, or by a number
of other methods, all of which can be shown to lead to equivalent
definitions.) The relevance of this to Life is that both Bill
Gosper and John Conway proved early on that it is possible to
construct a universal computer in the Life universe. (To prove
the universality of a <a href="#g6">cellular automaton</a> with simple rules was
in fact Conway's aim in Life right from the start.) Conway's proof
is outlined in <a href="#v3">Winning Ways</a>, and also in <a href="#lb">The Recursive Universe</a>.
<p>Until recently, no universal Life computer had ever been built in
practice, because it would be enormous, even with the improvements
that have been devised since those early proofs. In April 2000,
Paul Rendell completed a Turing machine construction which can be
seen at <a href="http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tm.htm">http://rendell.server.org.uk/gol/tm.htm</a>. This, however,
has a finite tape, as opposed to the infinite tape of a true
Turing machine, and is therefore not a universal computer.
But in November 2002, Paul Chapman announced the construction
of a universal computer, details of which can be found at
<a href="http://www.igblan.com/ca/">http://www.igblan.com/ca/</a>. This is a universal register machine
based around Dean Hickerson's <a href="#oy">sliding block memory</a>.
<p>See also <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<a name=c5><b>universal constructor</b></a> A pattern that is capable of constructing
almost any pattern that has a <a href="#vr">glider synthesis</a>. This definition is
a bit vague. A precise definition seems impossible because it has
not been proved that all possible glider fleets are constructible.
In any case, a universal constructor ought to be able to construct
itself in order to qualify as such. An outline of Conway's proof
that such a pattern exists can be found in <a href="#v3">Winning Ways</a>, and also
in <a href="#lb">The Recursive Universe</a>. The key mechanism for the production
of gliders with any given path and timing is known as side-tracking,
and is based on the <a href="#nt">kickback reaction</a>. A universal constructor
designed in this way can also function as a universal destructor
- it can delete almost any pattern that can be deleted by gliders.
<p>A universal constructor is most useful when attached to a
<a href="#z5">universal computer</a>, which can be programmed to control the
constructor to produce the desired pattern of gliders. In what
follows I will assume that a universal constructor always includes
this computer.
<p>The existence of a universal constructor/destructor has a number of
theoretical consequences.
<p>For example, the constructor could be programmed to make copies of
itself. This is a <a href="#uz">replicator</a>.
<p>The constructor could even be programmed to make just one copy
of itself translated by a certain amount and then delete itself.
This would be a (very large, very high period) <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>. Any
translation is possible (except that it must not be too small), so
that the spaceship could travel in any direction. It could also
travel slower than any given speed, since we could program it to
perform some time-wasting task (such as repeatedly constructing and
deleting a block) before copying itself. Of course, we could also
choose for it to leave some debris behind, thus making a <a href="#z6">puffer</a>.
<p>It is also possible to show that the existence of a universal
constructor implies the existence of a <a href="#h3">stable</a> <a href="#wk">reflector</a>. This
proof is not so easy, however, and is no longer of much significance
now that explicit examples of such reflectors are known.
<p>:<b>universal destructor</b> See <a href="#c5">universal constructor</a>.
<p>:<b>universal register machine</b> = <a href="#q6">URM</a>
<p>:<a name=dp><b>universal regulator</b></a> A <a href="#x9">regulator</a> in which the incoming gliders are
aligned to period 1, that is, they have arbitrary timing (subject
to some minimum time required for the regulator to recover from the
previous glider).
<p>Paul Chapman constructed the first universal regulator in March
2003. It is adjustable, so that the output can be aligned to any
desired period.

<p>:<a name=ps><b>volatility</b></a> The volatility of an <a href="#wu">oscillator</a> is the size (in cells)
of its <a href="#e5">rotor</a> divided by the sum of the sizes of its rotor and its
<a href="#c9">stator</a>. In other words, it is the proportion of cells involved in
the oscillator which actually oscillate. For many periods there are
known oscillators with volatility 1, see for example <a href="#rd">Achim's p16</a>,
<a href="#f8">figure-8</a>, <a href="#ko">Kok's galaxy</a>, <a href="#wr">mazing</a>, <a href="#af">pentadecathlon</a>, <a href="#wd">phoenix</a>,
<a href="#yo">relay</a>, <a href="#uv">smiley</a> and <a href="#b4">tumbler</a>. The smallest period for which the
existence of such statorless oscillators is undecided is 3, although
Dean Hickerson showed in 1994 that there are p3 oscillators with
volatility arbitrarily close to 1 (as is the case for all but
finitely many periods, because of the possibility of feeding the
gliders from a <a href="#ho">true</a> period <i>n</i> <a href="#gv">gun</a> into an <a href="#yy">eater</a>).
<p>The term "volatility" is due to Robert Wainwright. See also

<p>:<a name=qb><b>wick</b></a> A stable or oscillating linearly repeating pattern that can be
made to burn at one end. See <a href="#ai">fuse</a>.
<p>:<a name=h4><b>wickstretcher</b></a> A <a href="#f4">spaceship</a>-like object which stretches a <a href="#qb">wick</a>
that is fixed at the other end. The wick here is assumed to be
in some sense connected, otherwise most <a href="#z6">puffers</a> would qualify as
wickstretchers. The first example of a wickstretcher was found in
October 1992 (front end by Hartmut Holzwart and back end by Dean
Hickerson) and stretches <a href="#sx">ants</a> at a speed of <i>c</i>/4. This is shown
below with an improved back end found by Hickerson the following
month.
<p><a href='cells/wickstretcher.cells'><img src='cells/wickstretcher.png' width='402' height='138'></a></p>
Diagonally moving <i>c</i>/4 wickstretchers have also been built (see
<a href="#qz">boatstretcher</a>). In March 1999 Jason Summers constructed a very
large <i>c</i>/12 wickstretcher using <a href="#x0">switch engine</a> based puffers found
earlier by Dean Hickerson. The wick in this last case is the
simplest possible one: a single line of diagonal cells. In July
2000 Summers also constructed a <i>c</i>/2 wickstretcher, stretching a
p50 <a href="#so">traffic jam</a> wick. This was based on an earlier (October
1994) pattern by Hickerson.
<p>:<a name=sg><b>wicktrailer</b></a> Any extensible <a href="#kd">tagalong</a>, that is, one which can
be attached to the back of itself, as well as to the back of a

tagalong to occur again in the same place is often called the
period of the wicktrailer - this has little relation to the period
of the tagalong units themselves.
